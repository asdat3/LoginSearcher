```Part 1 https://youtu.be/eihYL8DRtO4
Part 2 https://youtu.be/ljY4pYZeQSY@everyone UPDATE: The release notes have received an edit

At the time of original posting, the recent HAB Proximity changes were not documented within the release notes, this has been rectified and we will be closely monitoring community feedback in regards to the meta changes this gameplay update brings.@everyone Making Monday a funday with Squad Update V2.9 ready to roll in your Steam Library now.

Check out the full release notes here: https://joinsquad.com/2021/06/28/squad-update-v2-9/@everyone Dont forget, today in 18 minutes we have a WIP playtest featuring changes to lighting/shadows. We would love to see as many people joining, especially those with lower end spec machines to see what impact this may have on performance.

The build is currently available on Squad - Public Testing within your Steam Library if you own Squad, and we hope to see you soon for the playtest.
Notes: https://steamcommunity.com/games/774941/announcements/detail/2999942440494613514@everyone This **Sunday 27th June 2021 at noon PDT** we have a WIP playtest featuring changes to lighting/shadows. We would love to see as many people joining, especially those with lower end spec machines to see what impact this may have on performance.

The build is currently available on **Squad - Public Testing** within your Steam Library if you own Squad, and we hope to see you soon on Sunday for the playtest.
Notes: https://steamcommunity.com/games/774941/announcements/detail/2999942440494613514SquadChat starting up! @everyone
https://www.twitch.tv/joinsquad@everyone Join us tomorrow, Friday 25th at 10:30am PDT (5:30pm UTC) as we'll be sitting down with some of the dev team for a SquadChat discussing our upcoming update V2.9, an upcoming playtest featuring BIG changes and taking your questions.

We'll see you then! https://www.twitch.tv/joinsquad@everyone Thanks to everyone for their submission on the above form so far, we are still accepting your feedback but as a heads-up we have had a lot of internal discussions and while monitoring the feedback from players, server owners and the modding community OWI have made the decision to re-open mods back into the licensed server browser *indefinitely*.

The same caveats from Phase 1 of the Open Modding event still apply: If we notice a major disruption to Squad we will pause the ability for mods to appear in the default browser.

Our intention here is to provide more ownership and collaboration to server owners and modders in working together to help provide the different experiences they are facilitating.tak@everyone

**How to install FiveM and play on Transport Tycoon:**
_You need a legit copy of Grand Theft Auto V on PC, such as the Steam, Epic or Rockstar Games Launcher versions._

 `1. ` Run Grand Theft Auto V and launch into Singleplayer at least once (to make sure the game works in the first place)
 `2. ` Download FiveM from their website: https://fivem.net/ (click the download button, read the EULA/ToS and click agree)
 `3. ` Follow the installation instructions, they should be straight forward enough (accept downloading caches and whatnot)
 `4. ` Once the installation is complete, launch FiveM to make sure you reach the main menu without issue
 `5a.` Find the server list under Servers / Play, you can search for "Transport Tycoon" there
 `5b.` Navigate to http://connect.tycoon.community/ and join a server via the shown list

You should now be able to enjoy the game! Welcome to Transport Tycoon!

We encourage using the Cfx.re Forums to report this issue properly, and to provide any information that may be requested there.

We have changed **Server 4** to run the **old game build**, which means you will be able to play there if you can't join other servers. It has been labeled as a "Compatibility Server" for the time being.

Do note that any new content that relies on the newest GTA Online DLCs will not exist or work on this server.Servers are currently being updated, expected downtime an hour or so.Hello there everyone (not going to ping <:heh:450035411004293120>) 

Some players are having some problems with their textures since the latest update of FiveM. There is a new setting "Extended Texture Budget" in your graphics settings in game, which should be above the texture settings. Increasing/decreasing this setting seems to fix the problem with textures for some players. If you have a similar problem with your textures, we recommend you take a look here and play a bit with this setting.Hey @everyone! 
Due to uncertainties around recent events we'd like to clarify what is actually going on behind the scenes.

**To clear up on the removal of some of our staff members in recent times:**

**Niv (Support)** was removed from the staff team for leaking critical information to bad actors over a long period of time.
**Slay (Admin)** was removed from the staff team for spreading details about the FRLLC changes while they were still being discussed.
**Wesley (previous Community Director)** abused their access to and knowledge of information, spreading it to bad actors. 
Over their career they've also elevated staff based on personal preference and bias, rather than potential performance as staff.
They have since been removed from the community entirely.


**When it comes to the First Responders LLC change, some of you have been wanting a reason:**

The management of First Responders LLC has been a long source of community mistrust and misinformation, 
turning the company into a central point for unwanted drama in the community. 
We want to remove the affiliation with this sub-community and thus are removing the company from our servers.
As to keep with what we've stated regarding companies before; we wanted to make the company jobs public whenever we disband the companies, hence why the jobs are being tweaked to fit the public ecosystem.
This change will allow anyone currently enjoying the FRLLC jobs to continue doing so, and for anyone who was unable to join the company in the first place (due to management bias).
The higher-ups in FRLLC were given this reason, but it appears to have been lost in translation and not properly relayed further.

***Details on the changes being made to the company jobs and content can be found in the previous announcement.***

Hopefully this clarifies some confusion that you might have!
 - <@!71676578244857856>, <@!106571525699682304> and <@!276135625344679946>
Any further questions or concerns can be sent directly in DMs to any of us.**Here you´ll get a little idea of how this job will work by devs:**

With the removal of FRLLC comes changes. Some of these changes include reusing items such as the defibkits and their box of pills. You will also get the added benefit of being able to use the old FRLLC exclusive vehicles with regular paramedic! I will go over each in how to obtain and then use them for their respective benefits!
First off lets talk about defibkits, you'll notice in illegal trucking 2 new transformers the **Illegal: Plastic Molding** and **Illegal: Defib Kit Charging** Firstly take your leftover **Scrap Plastic** from trucking to the **Illegal: Plastic Molding** to convert it to **Empty Defibkits** after which you will take it to **Illegal: Defib Kit Charging** to charge them to defibkits (they're the same items as when the company was around so make sure not to trash them!). Defibkits will now be used to obtain **10%** more xp per dropoff using **1 defibkit** each dropoff of patients

Secondly **Box of Pills** you once again take your **Scrap Plastic** over to **Illegal: Plastic Molding**, where you exchange for **Box of Empty Pill Capsules**. You'll then need to take your empty boxes to **Illegal: Liquor Ace** to fill them up and receive **Box of Full Pill Capsules**, after which you will head down to PillBox Hill Medical Centre where you can change jobs to **FRLLC TRUCKER**. This job will allow you to gain access to the job of Pill delivery where you will take your pill boxes around the map to different hospitals in exchange for ems tokens! 

    I know some of you are thinking to yourself you already make more than your ever use, well with this update we've adjusted the amount of
    ems tokens gained per callout to be about half, the old system flooded the market and made the tokens essentially useless as everyone had an overabundance thus no need to purchase any themselves.Hello there @everyone. 
Today we would like to inform you all that we have decided to make the company **First Responders LLC.**<:FRLLC:471131647962775564>  public. 

This means for all of you that FRLLC's jobs, their vehicles and perks will be integrated into the normal gameplay and thus every player will be able to access them. *The company will remain in existence until **June 22nd*** so that all its members have enough time to deposit their vouchers.

__For the employees of FRLLC there is some information:__
1. you don't have to worry about your items in the company storage, because this also remains and is made public. So you won't lose your access to it and you can still use it.
2. the same applies to vehicles.
3. medical reports should be turned in until June 22nd.
4. company cooldown will be reset by the developers.
------------

We will bring this update to the beta server (S5) soon, so that some of you can already get a small overview of this job.

In the end, please don't see it as a complete farewell to this company, but rather as a chance for each of you to try out these jobs and also the vehicles.
Last but not least, we would like to thank the FRLLC teams of the last 3 years for all their hard work that has been put into this company and what has finally come out of it. We hope you all can accept our decision and give this new job a chance.@everyone Hello lovely Community Members<:pepelove:825444983087300658> 
This is just a short announcement to let all of you know that we updated our rules tab in the F7 menu (in Game) a bit. Rules are sorted now in 3 different categories:

2. Chat Rules

Why?
Right now with 200m HQ range bonus faction have way more space to place their perks, but limit is blocking us so we can't create for example little spots with perks around the HQ radius. Also new perks like 15/25% vehicle boost vendors have like 10x limit (who is gonna place 10x boost?) when perks like job center or shops are limited to one.

How much?
Job center - 2-3 limit
ATM - 3 limit
Business Collector - 2 limit
Car wash - 3 limit
Clothing Store - 2 limit
Markets (this one is quite interesting) - at the moment you are limited to 6 markets of any kind, but there are also 6 possible markets, so realistically you will use one for each. So here I would suggest divide the limit between them and allow to place 2 or 3 of each.

I think that the price change would be needed cause otherwise it will make the current EMS vehicles useless for a lot of people and we would soon see everyone as EMS driving around in the FR Vehicles. (Also the old prices are from probably like at least 2 years ago so the economy was also different.)

7. Add EMS job to the Pill Box Hospital Job Changer which would make sense same as there was FRLLC Paramedic before.

Please share your opinion.

1. Keep the FRLLC Trucker job to keep it as it's stated in the announcement. 

2. Make it that you can deliver Boxes Of Full Pill Capsules as FRLLC Trucker only and not with any other type of job cause right now it's not locked to this job and you just need the required amount of pills on you to start the delivery.

3. FRLLC Trucker job doesn't let you spawn any trailers right now on S5. This job was made so that you can only use the FRLLC Trailers to produce the FR Goods and it would not let you spawn or use any other non FR Trailers. 
So you would need to let people spawn other trailers as FRLLC Trucker cause now it's kinda useless or simply leave this specific job as it was before which I think would be less of work for you.

4. Unlock the FRLLC Trailer MK4 (frllc_trailers4) and make the price higher up to about 250mil like the MK12 Trailer. (Current price is $80Mil and doesn't fit the current economy.)
   OR
   Increase the capacity to approximately 6500/7000 kg capacity and price higher to around 350mil.
   This would make the trailer a new option for players and would need to be placed between the MK13 & MK12
- I don't think anyone would mind the trailer being added if not even the majority of the community could have something new & cool as it was already in the company and is on the server.

I meant these random events should give double EXP/more EXP for a specific job, not for every job. I think this would make the server a bit more lively, with people switching thru different jobs rather than grinding a single job till lvl 100 and then going to the next job. It also doesn't have to be double EXP or money, it can also be an increase of just like 30%. I believe these random events are a bit like SOTD, just at random intervals and also the possibility to give an increase in money rather than just EXP.

With growing playerbase and number of players playing on OS (especially new ones that don't know about 32 slot servers) current location of (Trucking) Quarry transformer doesn't fullfill it's demand. Most of the time it's fully cramped and slows down truckers job and quarry workers too as they have their drop-off point there. It also discourages new players from doing it as no one wants to be rammed all the time or waiting long time in queues.

What?
I see two ways to resolve this issue.
1. Add additional (Trucking) Quarry transformer points to reduce ammount of trucks at one point.

2. Make whole Quarry a passive zone, it would massively help truckers and quarry workers donig their job and no one would would be rammed when processing goods.

Like I said before, it would encourage new players to also try the most popular routes, would stop potential ramming issues and quarry workers could keep doing their job without being blocked by trucks at their drop-off point.``ID 103888` **<@180064189023256576> TheBritishCookie** suggests: `Could we re-introduce the passive zone for the quarry.

I just thought of this after the suggestion but I feel like this might be the GOLDEN solution.


**Golden Solution Description**
I was thinking how certain routes produce a lot of items and would increase times in dumping each individual material like Sand, Flint, Raw Ore Mix etc.

So for maybe another solution would be to add in a button to Dump "ALL" From Truck. This could be a sub-menu thing after like selecting Dump From Truck so that you could still select certain items and custom amounts but still choose to dump all so that if you have a ton of items, it would still achieve efficiency and be the best of both worlds.

Thank you for reading :)``ID -98118` **<@290265902639742978> SGR** suggests: `
Adding an amount selection menu to "Dump From Truck" option.


I'm not sure why this isn't a feature already but I often find myself being limited when using the dump from truck feature.

For example, when I'm trucking and my trainyard almost fills up to the point of not accepting another full trailer worth of items, I am put in an awkward position where I can't fill up my trainyard to max capacity because I can't choose a specific amount.

The ability to choose a custom amount or item is already in the "Take To Truck" option so I'm wondering why we can't have the same process in the dump from truck menu. I think this feature would be extremely helpful especially since you have to manually calculate the remaining storage and weight of an item to select the accurate amounts to take for the next run.


**Solution #1**
The first solution is the ability for the Dump From Truck option to automatically transfer the remaining amount of items that can be stored into a self storage area, such as a trainyard.

**Solution #2**
The second solution is to add a menu just like the Take To Truck option where I can select the item and the amount I want to transfer.

Instead of driving around the map trying to get the 400+ blips, why not add level locked regions
like we have in firefighter. And when you've collected all the garbage in that region you will receive 
extra xp/money as a reward.

For example, you start your job in the same place(s) and the game will randomly select a route that you've unlocked. 
You will be notified what region you have to collect garbage and after you're done you get a reward, and when there are new 
people playing garbage collection (because of sotd, dxp) it will try to avoid low level regions so it won't be as busy.

I think randomly selecting the region will stop "meta" players who only want to do the same route over and over
again because it gives alot of xp.

For completing the current route you're rewarded with - 4000 bxp.
I think for completing a region it should reward you with - 200 to 600 bxp

Examples of regions: https://imgur.com/a/Pxl5J3o
Bigger region = more blips = bigger reward
For clarity, you would have to manually start your job at the local waste deposit. 
As example if you wanna do the Sandy Shores regions you would have to go the waste deposit there and start it there, 
only then would you have acces to the two regions and only those two.
I know Liberty City currently doesn't have a waste deposit but they could add it.

People enjoy feeling rewarded for a short amount of time spent, even if it means getting less rewards in the end.
Thats why i feel like this could help people enjoy garbage collection more.

Addition to the suggestion above:

In terms of balancing economy, I feel like most people just reach a certain level in gambling and never touch it again, unless they want to get 1 million XP.

I feel like adding many more options for gambling, maybe even the casino interior, would incentivise people to gamble for a bigger reason than just reaching level 100. This would in turn get more people gambling and more money lost.

Gambling Rework

Firstly, I'm not sure if gambling was made this way on purpose and it's sole reason is to make people lose money.

I feel like there should be more gambling, like actual gambling, stuff like blackjack or roulette or other luck based games, maybe even crash. I feel like adding an actual gambling system could help balance the economy, especially if people get addicted :heh:

I also think it should be more interactive and require more than just pressing enter to reach level 100 in gambling or 1 million XP. I'm not sure but I think other gambling games are certainly possible development wise so I'm not sure exactly what other reason there might be for not making gambling a bit more extensive.``ID 289911` **<@208636769208500224> ShadowRush2112** suggests: `Add a despawn timer to ungutted animals or to the icon that shows you can gut an animal.

It would probably become one of the most active and organic leaderboards over any other leaderboard because everyone who gets into advanced trucking starts with concrete usually. So it would change often and would also create a fun competitive environment of concrete grinding. I prefer concrete over houses for example so I grind it about 85% of my time on TT and would love to see how I'm doing against other concrete grinders or just simply how much I've made in total because stats are fun for gamers. I would imagine, logically, it's just a copy and paste of other leaderboard code and changing the item ID of what it's logging to concrete, but you're the professionals - maybe it's not that easy?

Make an official start date on the first of the next month that you add it or something with an announcement and let us concrete grinders race to the top of it. It would have to calculate concrete mixed, not concrete sold, to be accurate. I'll probably never care to do houses so this would be an awesome addition for people with the same mentality that stick to concrete and would make it feel that much more accomplishing after spending hundreds of hours making one of the premium trucking route items.``ID 302555` **<@255133658036305949> H e r e t i k** suggests: `As a few people asked, it could be a good idea to move the Beta server to the 2nd machine. it would make the beta test more efficient.``ID 411029` **<@311602729086746624> RED** suggests: `Upvote J7Q's Suggestion``ID 440187` **<@571803993408536577> J7Q** suggests: `

Since i want to make it as detailed as possible forgive the length of it.

So as one player that has gathered a lot of boosts i consider myself someone who knows a lot about this topic. My sample size consisted of about 1000 boosts that i collected all on my own.
The following numbers are just my personal observations and probably do not match the reality perfectly.

I will sort the boosts by their current ( my data ) drop chances to give you an idea how common the different types are:

1. 15% 1 Hour approx. 80% Drop Chance
2. 10% 90 Minutes approx. 12% Drop Chance
3. 5% 2 Hours approx. 3-5% Drop Chance
4. 5% 1 Day approx. 2% Drop Chance
5. 5% 1 Week approx. 0.5 - 1% Drop Chance
6. 50% 10 Minutes approx. 0.25 - 0.5% Drop Chance

So with the full overview my suggestion. Make 1. less common in order to give 3. a boost of around 5% , then give 4. about 3% boost and 5. about 2% . In my opinion number 6. should still be the rare collectors item but the rest is fairly unbalanced to really be used or appreciated by anyone. People don't find those, people can't afford to buy them at their realistic price right now.

On this totally normal OS day, <@!293479170447638528> went to Los Santos Airport and said "*I need to collect my cash stacks and get my YouTube money..*" when suddenly he noticed something a bit unusual.
After checking the situation and going on top of the parking garage he saw the Cargo P-3 Orion plane at the building next to him.. <a:PlaneLandingBlink:588766981298192432> the owner, 528070 | **Hakus** was not able to be found anywhere.
After taking the evidence, he called the local towing company <:bat:499021524313833476> which took care of this great looking plane.<:breaking:717475789448151121><:news:717475808104415312> **LIVE** from OneSync! <:breaking:717475789448151121><:news:717475808104415312>

Sadly we could not find the owner but we would like to let you know to __please do not drive your ships & boats on the roads.__ <:heh:450035411004293120> 
The local towing company had no idea how to get rid of such special cargo so it was required to take the Reefer apart in small pieces with the help of the mechanics.<:breaking:717475789448151121> <:news:717475808104415312> **Live from OneSync**

This will make thing much easier for us to manage and automate things. We will also be integrating this with each of our servers so expect to see some special features in-game in the **FUTURE**.


**What if I already donated do I still have to be a patreon?**
No, all previous supports are considered Early Supporters and will have all of the perks that come with the highest tier on patreon.


**Can we still support using patreon if we already donated.**
Yes, but this is totally up to you.


All donations will go towards the server bills. You are not obligated to become a pateron. All patreon supports will recieve rewards depending on their tier. To those who have donated already or are planning to we thank your for you support.

The new framework is lighter on the client and a lot of the things the old framework did has been redesigned and thought about with the knowledge I've gained over the past 2 years.

With this, I'm aiming to add in some new features that users didn't have before and also allow it to expand for future features like Outfits, Inventories, and GPS Locations (No more telling them what blip to look for ay).

So 2021 is a start of improvement, and I hope the entire community will be happy with these changes. Please remember, I will be checking suggestions at the end of the month, so if you have an idea and can flesh it out (sell it to me), then a good discussion can take place.

**Note: This does delay weapons being added, but is essential work which will allow adding of weapons and new features**

Link is also in the channel description as found in the header of the channel.Few delays... because... yes, I'm finally doing this...IF ANYONE ASKS, about weapons, direct them to this post...

Weapons are currently being reworked so they require licenses to be used in game, you as a player will be able to buy a license to use a type of weapon.

If you want to know why I didn't just add weapons, its because of the general players base just joining the server and shooting at everyone, in short, its the minority of trolls that have made it worse for the rest.Once ID or question is asked, its no longer enabled but the ID information will be kept on the menu;Slowly; but surely;<@!589571343054274568>Just to you all know... I am working on it...Also some research and ideas for what I've been working on.||You better watch out
You better not cry
Better not pout
I'm telling you why
I'm going to kill you today.

WIPoooooooo this fix....The mess I make when testing something for Police to do...Appearance menu completed... next... Apparel...@here

Its been a while but as a part of changes I'm working on for the future of the Curiosity framework I thought all of you might like to see some of the initial work on changes for when you join the server.

Note: This will only be required on your characters initial start, once you have completed this it will always log you in where you last logged off.

So, been working on the mission system and improving areas to it. This is the first pass to a new mission, in which the method of completion has not even been decided yet but aye... The Lost want some chems from the Humain Labs and its your job to stop them... You'll find out more when its ready to go.

*Radio Audio credit to LSPDFR who are a large part of the inspiration to making this*@here I'm still tweaking this... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcRPZrkXwacTad busy with this one, cause you know we want to make Helicopters do something@here Just a heads up as I have not posted here for a while.

Traffic Stops... well, now I have had people using them its allowed me to find various issues a lot easier (its rather hard to notice issues on your own, you become blind sighted to small issues) so I have been working on refactoring/redesigning how Traffic Stops will work along with NPC interaction overall (this will bring updates to call outs that I wanted before building more).
I have currently started work on how the menu interaction with NPCs, this will allow the following;
* Apply/Remove Handcuffs (without initiating an arrest)
* Detain (without initiating an arrest, requires handcuffs to be applied)
* Grab/Move (without initiating an arrest, requires handcuffs to be applied)
* Perform CPR - Information closer to the time of release
* Request Prisoner Transport
I will also be changing some of the Vehicle options but will update you all when that is ready to be discussed.When you get sick of all the chatter; you'll soon be able to select the channel you want to use and only get messages from that channel to pop up on your screen.@here Told you all to give me some time...New features for traffic stops are coming along nicely:@here Guess you've all wondered why I've been busy... Still have things to add into this so by no means is this the finished product.Well... they didn't want to stop...Adding an option to turn off backup notifications, more to come...Should we create a forums for LifeV? https://www.strawpoll.me/18449517 @everyoneSo we would like to know your thoughts on merging all server into one server.

Why? Because we have a lot of channels within this discord server. When we decide to host a Cryofall server, it can quickly lose it within the number of channel(s) within this discord server.  We had done this in the past when we invited few people from the interested community. We have archived the gaming channels from this discord to clear things up.

We want it to be a friendly environment for ALL to enjoy. Feel free to invite your friends and people may not have FiveM.

Any character that is under the age of 18 for the duration of the content of which they appear ( Tv show, movie, comic book etc) is not allowed to be portrayed in a sexual manner on the server or the Pornhub website. 

If a character becomes of age during the duration of the content in which they appear, the character may be portrayed in a nsfw manner in the 18+ form. 

If a cosplay is in question for nsfw content produced by models, the video will be reviewed and if found to portray an underage character the content will be removed. 

Cosplay content where an underage character is “Aged up for that specific video” will be removed.

Be mindful of the character you are portraying.

For example: 

Daenerys Targaryen- Game Of Thrones

Start of the books- age 13
Start of the Tv show-16

If you portray her in the TV show or book version of when she is sold to Khal Drogo, she is under the age of 18 in both. If you portray her when she (spoiler alert!) arrives back home to Dragonstone she is over the age of 18 in the show, but considering the time line differential that the book follows this may not be the case for when the next two books actually arrive. 

The time line moves a bit slower in the duration of the books, for example “A Dance With Dragons” only two to three  years have passed since the first appearance of Daenerys in “A Game Of Thrones” so she is only about 15 or 16 years old, where as the shows are typically said to have about a year in between each so she would be 21 or 22 years old in season 5.

Point being, please keep ALL of the aspects of the character you are portraying in mind and if any discrepancies are brought to attention, the produced content will be reviewed and removed if deemed inappropriate. 

Cosplay content found to violate any of these regulations will be removed from the server and/or Pornhub in accordance with TOS.*Viewers Choice*

Viewers Choice is a monthly contest held on Pornhub! You can win prizes, gain views and it’s great exposure! The top 50 videos appear on the Pornhub front page! Each month has it's own theme so make sure to check it out and have fun with it! For how to enter and the theme of the month check here:

A common misconception a lot of people have about sex work is that it’s “easy” and that is simply not true. Just because someone posts their tits online doesn’t mean that they have buyers lining up. Porn is everywhere! When you market yourself and your brand you need to make it stand out, you need to post frequently and you need to produce a product that people want!  Posting frequently across platforms, engaging people with exciting posts and teaser pics  and keeping people interested in your product is key. Don't forget to HAVE FUN with your product creation! Let your awesome sauce shine through!

https://help.pornhub.com/hc/en-us/categories/202715537-Model-Payment-Program*How do I become a “Model Of The Week” Feature?*


- To be considered for Model of the Week, all you have to do is send me (Zobie) a DM with your Pornhub link, a short bio (preferably in third person), a promo photo, and any other links you want to include (reddit, social media, fanclub, etc) to be put on the list! You can see the <#633387148522815489> channel for examples if you need help

- EVERYONE is eligible to be considered for model of the week but we prefer to promote and feature those who are a good representative of this community and of Modelhub! If you have any questions, comments, or concerns about that, please do not hesitate to contact myself, Kitty, or Demi

- Model of the Week is run on a "first come, first serve" basis meaning I post them in order that I am contacted to keep it fair. Sometimes posts may be delayed and there may be a bit of a backlog from when you contact me to when you get featured so please keep that in mind and stay patient! If you need to update any information or pictures before yours gets posted, please reach out to me! 

- Please be friendly and supportive of your fellow models. Don't be toxic about this, please. Everyone has a chance to be featured, your time will come. Be supportive and mindful about it! Even if its something simple as subscribing. Just keep that in mind!*How do I Geo-Block areas on Pornhub?*

https://www.pornhub.com/model/geo*How do I avoid being scammed?*

With any type of transactions it is important for both sellers AND buyers to keep their eyes open for red flags. It is NOT the servers responsibility for what happens in dms so you need to protect yourself. We suggest only working with verified buyers and sellers, being verified on Modelhub or other professional platforms is a bonus!*Fan Club Feature*

What is it? The fan club feature is a monthly subscription service that comes with some great benefits! You have the ability to upload exclusive videos and pictures for your fans eyes only, message exclusivity and post alerts!

You can set up perks for your fans such as discounts on your paid videos, downloading, individual custom discount packages and more! 

You can set your fan club up here:
https://www.pornhub.com/model/modelhub/fanclub*What kinds of content should I make?*

When creating any kind of art it is important to do what you love to do! Whatever you choose to make, it should make you happy and you should have fun doing it. Creating something that you enjoy making is what makes for good quality content. Need ideas? Search for the things you have interest in on Pornhub and check out some of the things others have done. Take inspiration from any kind of kinky fun you like! Producing your product is something you should be proud of. Make it yours and make it fun!*How to tag videos properly*

Utilizing the tagging feature when uploading a new video is very important as that is how people will find the video when they use the search option. For example, when you upload a brand new Foot Fetish video, make sure to tag it with multiple related tags such as “Feet” “Toes” “Barefoot” “Barefeet” etc. The tags are not interchangeable when searched for specifically so when someone searches the term “Foot” Only videos tagged with the word “Foot” will show up, not videos tagged with only “Feet”. The limit for tagging is 16, use as many that apply as possible! 

It is also important to note that the title of your video is included in your searchable tags for said video, so there is no need to add tags of the same key words included in your title.*How do I claim videos of mine that I found posted by others on Pornhub?*

If you find that someone has stolen your video and posted it on Pornhub, you can email the link to models@pornhub.com with a short message stating that you are the owner of that content ( Don’t forget to include your PH link!)  The video can be added to your page and you will gain the views, revenue and control over the video. You also have the option to take the video down or make it private once its on your page. If your video has been added to a compilation style video it can not be claimed by you BUT it can be removed.

https://help.pornhub.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005960587-Exclusivity-and-Protecting-your-Content-*What are the benefits of signing up for Modelhub?*

Building your empire is never an easy task. The important thing to remember is the more new eyes you get on your page, the better! Marketing and momentum are key in gaining subscribers and maintaining fans! Chatting with people across assorted platforms, being personable and approachable also help! You can also find a ton of useful information and tips here:  https://www.pornhub.com/blog/10701*Posting Etiquette*

When advertising on the server, please remember that no price menus are allowed in the ModelHub channels 

When advertising on the server please use the proper channels for posting and make sure your photos are always accompanied by a link ( To your Pornhub, Twitter, AllMyLinks etc!) Furthermore please post your own SOLO ONLY photos when advertising on any of the modelhub channels except the couples channel.

Please do not use the fetish/kink channels for advertising your direct links, you can post relevant porn in those channels but NO ADVERTISING!

Please be respectful when posting, try not to post several times in a row if yours is the most recent to give everyone a chance to be the first thing people see when opening the channel.

You can post in the model lounge about meetups, your pics or your links for advice and ideas!<:z_modelclub:580504251554463763> **MODEL OF THE WEEK** <:z_modelclub:580504251554463763>

So generally anything from before 2000 (according to most sites.) More specifically, its usually porn content from before the 90s and generally films/videos/pictures that appear as if they are from tapes, old film, retro style, etc. Basically anything that wasn't digital. So just to clear that up, please make sure we're sharing things that fit the category! And if it doesn't fit, find somewhere else to share it. Thanks!How is this vintage? <@&393477524417675267> can you help, thanksI have to agree since when i think of vintage i think of it having that low budget, vhs style look which isn't in anything post 2000<@!552921078268297227>that's wine not people, hell i dare say a person is JUST starting to mature at 23, besides this is porn. i point us all to the google of varius sources for the definition of "vintage" . . ( An item should be at least 100 years old to be defined as an ***antique***. Generally speaking if the item is no older than an antique (100 years) but not less than 20 years, it falls under the term ***vintage***.) I.E. 0-20 years is not vintage, but again this is porn sooooo who the hell caresi feel like anything post 2000 isnt vintagehttps://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/527003137152778243/818682846779801641/video0.mp4https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/798949036714623026/816883355273527296/bdsmlr-9760838-F5CtazfLNE.gifhttps://cdn08.bdsmlr.com/uploads/photos/2019/10/35569/bdsmlr-35569-LZhYEzjSZx.gifhttps://thumbs.gfycat.com/SlightSnivelingGermanshepherd-mobile.mp4https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/744628490279714907/830426961427693588/image0.gif**Hello everyone,

Hello to all!
I decided today to open a temporary store to help finance the project. 
If you participate in the financing, please let me know so that I can give you a rank on the discord, that if you will give you access to a channel where I will post all spoil, me and the 3D modelers

Edit: You can participate in any amount, free to put what you want!

Hello everyone!

I decided to make a post on the forum to share the project and try to get a few more people to help move the project forward! If you like this one, don't hesitate to give your opinion on the post!

https://forum.cfx.re/t/warv-call-of-duty-but-on-fivem-pvp-server-ranked-match/2978049The WarV project is a project that consists in reproducing a similar experience of Call Of Duty but on FiveM. The goal is really to feel in another game than FiveM.

The server is still under development, both in terms of game modes and maps, if you want to support the project, please contact a respective developer:


Menu UI/Gamemode: <@!100227684906340352> 
In game UI: <@!317408028943056907> 
Map Design: <@!241189525064384512>

Beta test sessions are organized to test the different features under development. Please watch the channel ( <#846334580432306176>  ) if you want to participate to a beta session.
During a session, the test server will be accessible by everyone, feel free to invite your friends, however please take into account that this is a beta test, if major bugs are found it is possible that the gamemode is restarted to fix the problem.<a:loading:635932222204936192> In progress <a:loading:635932222204936192>https://streamable.com/a6n9m4

Notes: https://steamcommunity.com/games/774941/announcements/detail/2999942440494613514SquadChat starting up! @everyone
https://www.twitch.tv/joinsquad@everyone Join us tomorrow, Friday 25th at 10:30am PDT (5:30pm UTC) as we'll be sitting down with some of the dev team for a SquadChat discussing our upcoming update V2.9, an upcoming playtest featuring BIG changes and taking your questions.

We'll see you then! https://www.twitch.tv/joinsquad@everyone Thanks to everyone for their submission on the above form so far, we are still accepting your feedback but as a heads-up we have had a lot of internal discussions and while monitoring the feedback from players, server owners and the modding community OWI have made the decision to re-open mods back into the licensed server browser *indefinitely*.

The same caveats from Phase 1 of the Open Modding event still apply: If we notice a major disruption to Squad we will pause the ability for mods to appear in the default browser.

Our intention here is to provide more ownership and collaboration to server owners and modders in working together to help provide the different experiences they are facilitating.@here 
**Host**: Project Awesome Events 
**Server**: Project Awesome Events Server
**Theme**: Mod Showcase | Hawks RAAS Rework and Custom Layers
**Date**: July 3rd, 2021
**Event Briefing**: 18:45 UTC | Event Start: 19:00 UTC

**Brief**
A new normal way of playing the game! GRAAS!

What is GRAAS? GRAAS is Good-RAAS, a completely new way of designing RAAS layers. Basically, it allows for a hybrid between full-random points, and the lane system used in Vanilla. Squad lanes will be useless because GRAAS supports lane jumping to an adjacent lane. Basically, if you’re on the center, it can stay center, or go we t/east. If you’re on east, it can stay east or go center, etc. Even once you know the points, you still wont be able to predict 2 points ahead accurately.

We will be playing a few layers of the mod!

**How to join**
This event will be played on our event server in the custom tab of Squad. You can signup on reddit right here:

We are Mountain Infantry (MI), a squad clan from China, recently we plan to set matches with exotic clans, and it is our pleasure to set a match with your clan. We know there will be lots of problems and troubles to make this happen. So we list some issues we think we have a solution to solve with.
1. Time difference - If we want to make this match happen, this is the number one problem we will face. Here’s what we think to solve it, we can set this match either on your Friday night or on your Saturday noon, or even when these two time will not fit your players time, you guys can choose one, we will try to make sure there are enough players to participate.
2. Network delay (Laggin issue) - What we have in mind is set two matches total, each clan’s server hold one game, so we can minimum the delay issue influence.
3. Numbers of players - This is the easiest problem, you choose the number, we are a large enough clan to make that happen.
4. Discord - Because of the policy we have here, we cant use discord in China. But we have friends who live in other countries, and they are kind enough to help us use discord to contact with you.
So far, Here are the four main problems we think are going to stop the match happen. If you think this exotic match will be a mark on squad, and want it to happen, please contact with me through email (101073116@qq.com) or add my steam id is 45505756.** **

(sorry I couldn't show a better example I had to keep the video under 8mb)**series of events that makes me believe OWI doesn’t play their own game**. OWI: increases FOB sizes meaning less FOBs on the map. 
Me: Most likely to stop some kind of FOB spam or something??? 
OWI: allows fobs to be proxy from 80m
Me: wait, does OWI even know that some cap zones aren’t even that big??? Ok now I need to FOB spam more because the second a the enemy team gets CLOSE TO THE OUTSIDE area of a flag, I lose the ability to spawn there.  
OWI: haha to bad you can’t fit a second fob anywhere reasonable with the 400m radius.
Me: ok I guess rally’s are meta now.
OWI: nope, we’re nerfing those too.

Squad have had fob spamming and defense not being focused on for too longProxy within 80m? Is this squad anymore?Why do i feel that every update OWI brings into this game makes it less enjoyable? 80m hab disable radius just changes your "Give up, spawn HAB" meta into "Run from main" meta.. <:Facepalm:443768801993949184>Regarding the HAB Proximity.
8People can proxy a HAB with a radius of **80m**  ->
quick Math guide: the mathematics of a circle is [pi multipled with r(squarded)!!]

The old proxy: r=30m ~ 2830m² / the new proxy: r(max)=80 ~ 20100m²

You widend the **area to defend** befor getting overrun - over **7 times** larger.
I know you want to make it easy to remember "everybody counts 10m" but blowing up the mathematics and taking the brakes off the train will hit you hard...

My suggestion:  proxy HAB with 2 within 30m(old) but you need 2 more guys to get 10m more.
        *2ppl = 30m / 4ppl = 40m / 6ppl = 50m / 8ppl = 60m*

quick math:  r(max)= 60m  ~  11310m²

conclusion: you still double the radius - widens the area to defend by 4.I really like HAB mechanic change. It prevents HAB spamming, and makes hunting for them more valuable tactic (denying a hab/radio will clear a huge area).Replace map lore on loading screens with information about ingame mechanics that aren't necessarily obvious. Examples could include how proxying works, distance for burning rallies, how to buddy rally, could show armour on a couple vehicles (would gradually reinforce with everybody), how vehicle bleedout timers work, etc. There's a pretty large barrier to information in this game that could be easily fixed

Could include an option in settings to return to the map loreCan the AKM get a fresh graphical update? I would like to see it have a more rugged or worn out texture to really fit its frequent appearance among insurgents and militias. <a:RWbounce:423966409232744449>smaller maps should keep the 300m radiusGive the AKS74U a facelift/remaster and give it back to some insurgent and militia infantry roles, I remember when they were a staple of their AT kits and its a very fun weapon to use in game, relegating it to crewman roles only is sad and wastes its potentialThe Hab overrun, i can understand the increase to 3 in 30 meters, that allows for more team dynamics and team/fire team reliance and requirements to overrun a hab but beyond, at most 40 meters, overrunning a hab with a radius of 400 meters breaks not only many smaller maps, such as Chora, Sumari and Logar, but makes it so if one squad is within 90 or 80 meters of a hab, it disables the only spawn for the enemy team in most circumstances on a main objective.

How is that an improvement toward team dynamics and team oriantated gameplay, when the other team now has to run from main to participate in the game?What about keeping the old overrun mechanics, but also adding in a new mechanic that just increases spawn time at longer ranges when there are enough enemies?Can we get the 74U on some combat kits please? It's way too cool a gun to be restricted to crewmanAdd an optional color index to fob markers for visualization of the proxy rangesIf you do keep the current FOB nerf in place, which I don't think is a good idea, consider buffing rallies by changing them so they can't be burnt by vehicles.Sumari RAAS 2 commander drone view. Need I say more?Add a arma 3 stance system. Does not have to be as complicated but would make shooting over sandbags and walls easier.This image is why the HAB proxy mechanics need to be toned down, especially on smaller maps. If I was on US and put my FOB on Mumbles along with the HAB, it can be proxied immediately by people I have almost no chance of killing if the BTR is sitting next to Saddam's. 

It's ridiculous how badly some people want this game to be slowed down, and by these means too. There is no way that anyone who plays the game could have thought: "Yeah, I'll build a FOB that's able to be proxied from the building on the west side of Hemp." 

Also, while discussing Chora, wtf? AAS v2 is the holy grail of layers, and it worked perfectly fine before. I don't know what the person who thought this was a good idea was thinking. "Yeah, adding a second Stryker is perfect, now we can have *two* headglitching .50 cals!"

The 400m exclusion radius definitely needs to be set back to 300m on smaller maps, such as Sumari (lol as if it wasn't bad enough already), Chora, Fallujah, Kokan, Logar Valley, and Narva. The larger maps like Yeho, Tallil and Gorodok are still frustrating but acceptable. You shouldn't be able to be *totally* fucked over by an SL who places a FOB at the police station on Sumari.Add dynamic fob radius generation based on layer size, with a min radius of 50 and a max of 300 a v of 2 or 3 is probably a good starting point 
```python
#all units im meters
v = 2
outer_fob_radius = v*sqrt(max(map_X)),[[50]], ]]300[[
```80 meter overrunning mechanic will cause very weird situations in maps like Sumari. It's difficult enough to build HAB's up in small maps and now they will get overrun due to some guys running around a block away?In response to Ozone's third point, if overrun mechanics are something the devs are deadset on changing, simply:
Change the amount of people required within the 30m to 3 or 5 as that will require more teamwork, than spamming bodies into a 80m radius1. Chora AAS V2 never needed a second stryker, only the Crows MRAP back maybe
2. 400m grey FOB radii isn't the right solution to hab spam meta, increasing ticket value of FOB's to 15 or 20 quite possibly is. Otherwise, two differential radii based on layer size would be a viable alternative. Don't complicate this more than needed.
3. The hab overrun mechanics were okay as they were, 60m was bad, 80m is ridiculous.If u lose a fob the enemy is getting +10 tickets and u lose 20.HAB's happen because they are far better than rallies and having more choices of where to spawn and more HAB's supporting each other is betterLmao you already know, pls make betterAdditionally hab spam happens because habs are weak. By making fobs have a 400m exclusion radius you are only making people want to increase hab spam. Keep habs the way they are, there's no need to change something that worked perfectly finePerhaps the FOB and build radius could be different depending on the map? Getting multiple HABs on Sumari was already hard, might want to allow FOBs every 300m just for those smaller mapsHAB spam was (and still will be) the meta for a reason. 400m change isn't a fix, its a hinderance without something else accompanying it. If the Build radius was upped to 200m it might actually do something good. Right now, HAB spam is the meta cause it's the only thing that works(consistently)Why CANT Ticked bleeds, ticked gain and loss on cap, FOB RANGES be on server conf files why just ruin the game becouse few players cant push enemy habs next to points?V2.9 free look seem doesn't workits kinda bothering me how Abrams is now king of all tanks (as if it wasnt before).
1. Ammo rack is unreacheable with frontal shot. any other tank can be 2-shot from the front, and now you cant return fire if you are racked
2. 1.5 sec faster reload rate than any other tank
3. Couldn't consistently penetrate abrams's turret ring, apart from cannon breach section. Has something to do with new turret meshes or was it changed at all in latest patch?I have found more complaints. First a striker vs a btr 80 (Shit box btr) is not a fair fight. Chora AAS v2 was known as the good layer for chora. There is now 2 strikers + 2 mraps vs and 80, 82, and a tiger. To add context, it use to only be 1 striker. Also US was already the more likely side to win that layer. It is now the bad layer. This also is hand in hand with the fact that chora is ruined with fob radius adjustments as expressed above.

need to fix turret jitter before implementing the network to other vehicles.

This is in regards to the delayed death of a vehicle shot in the ammo rack. If someone shoots a vic in the ammo rack, it should blow up as a reward... this is just buffing every vic with vulnerable ammo racks at that point.

Thanks for fixing fall damage at least a little bit.When OWI released the "Roadmap" everyone got excited and saw the potential of this game, I was one of them. But weeks turned into months, months turned into years yet only minor patches got released. 

OWI tried to explain why the major patches couldn't be released and came with poor excuses like "it's a living roadmap and it might change".

The core of the community that pitch in at the start have lost its faith towards OWI because of the constant delays and major game-breaking issues. 

OWI needs to show the community by actually start releasing what they've promised and not come up with more excuses to why this or that couldn't be released.

A step in the right direction is actually fixing and optimizing the game. 

A step in the wrong direction is implementing features that doesn't really need to be added at this time.

Listen to the community, hear them out and see what they want.The 400 meter FOB radius has the idea to reduce HAB spam but people will still spam HAB's as much as possible and it hasn't reduced the motivation to spam them out. HAB's are far better than rally's and essential to take another defended HAB in an equal fight otherwise you will just be outspawned and eventually 1 person will find and walk over your rally or a vic will drive around to knock it out. 

Better solution is to double the costs of HAB and ammo crate so that you need to do more runs to get more HAB's, right now 1800 construction = 3 HAB's and most maps you get 3 logi's so that's 9 HAB's without a single resupply. Would be far better if it took 900 or 1000 construction to reduce the amount of HAB's builtLove the return of 400m exclusion, now people actually need to put thought into hab placement.
hab spam has been ruining gameplay for too long and this is a great first step in mitigating itJust a stupid idea but "Joint Operation Layers" should be a thing in the future. Imagine getting support from a British Armoured Division while you part of an American Infantry Regiment. Or an American Ground based strike group getting support from the local militia (MEA) thru transports and infantry.To this point, having some sort of hand signal system could be very useful. Comms can get very difficult to hear when there are vehicles, gunfire etc or if you're squad leader and command chat is going. The ability to communicate with squad members via hand signals could be very useful in scenarios when you're next to an MRAP shooting its .50 CAL and you're all but deaf.New 400m radius makes no sense, completely ruins good maps. Y’all did pretty good this update imo but idk what was going through your guy’s heads with this new hab radius.I guess i have to be that guy. The development is one year behind the old roadmap. Still no marines, no fastropes, no Aussies, no OP Anvil, no Black Coast, no insurgency rework, no localization and Pan Asia is pushed to 2022. And someone in the management looked at this schedule and said: "Let's waste time and manpower on freaking shadows." Especially after already implementing forced shadows. GJon talil invasion v1 the spandrel is a huge problem and honestly one of the main reasons that attackers lose so easily and so often it honestly either needs to be taken off the layer, delayed, or give the U.S. a TOW MRAP to counterThe addition of the second stryker to Chora AAS v2 is a bad decision, the layer has favoured the US team strongly for a long time before this addition. This change reads like you don't understand your own gameplay.Please consider re-adding the old Gorodok AAS v2 layer of US vs GB. It played excellently, and with the addition of the GB helicopter there are no more shared assets between the two. Don't be afraid of BLU on BLU factions PLEASE! 

Also, if you're holding off due to the layer rework, please don't. Who knows when that'll be fully implementedYeho RAAS V4 currently has 2 BTR 80s vs 2 Strykers. The BTR does not have stabilization nor the autofeeding of the Stryker and is just not balanced at all IMO. Please replace US strykers with either CROWS MATVs or 1 Stryker.Cricket sound is still there on Mutaha Inv v2 on 2.9, don't really want to classify it as a bug, probably just an oversight when making the layerChora AAS v2 vehicle balancing was unnecessary, after the Chora foliage rework awhile back the BTR-82 was indirectly nerfed on this layer (more difficult farm from upper orchard). This layer is a community favorite, especially in the competitive circle, and changing anything on it seems unnecessary and tone-deaf. If anything, the Russians could've received a slight buff on this layer with another open-top TIGR, since this layer is already US-sided with the timings to Hemp Farm.The removal of the Simir Kornet from most layers is a good step forwards. 

What I see in almost all of the layers that have the Simir Kornet is "Alright, we've made a fair vehicle balance, now let's give MEA a *Simir Kornet*, that's a good idea!" 

Yes, MEA are generally at a disadvantage vehicle-wise but you also need to consider that they get a HAT kit with two tandems. This means it can take out anything in the game without rearming.I do like the forward spawn change however, on paper the invasion changes seem like they will work well.Just want to put this out there, this change wasn't needed. Yes, both were cancer but this is such a long range map vehicle-wise that the Spandrel was needed. The M1A2s needed to prioritize taking out the spandrel before anything else.```Adjusted vehicle balance on Chora AAS v2 – USA with 2x M1126 APC & 2x MATV versus RUS with 1 BTR82A, 1x BTR80, 1x Tigr.```

Excuse me? Who decided that this needed balancing? The layer was already US sided by a fair margin.

And now the US has a 2nd Stryker??Fog of War can be disabled by anyone who has the perms on a live server.could we have a raas without fog of war? so the points are randomized however they can all be seen like normal aaswhat would be fun is more blufor vs blufor layers like Canada vs UK or the US vs UKWe need more layers overall. There are plenty POIs on the maps, and many different possible combinations of vehicles across the factions, yet we only have 1-2 aas per map, a couple more raas and same goes to invasion and other game modes. It would be cool if you make a lot of aas layers and only 1-2 raas, but heavily randomised, so it isn't like gorodok raas v4, where you know exactly where "random" flags will be.Pls delete the spandrel from yehorivka invasion v2. Currently The Americans with only 2 Bradley's and a Stryker or so have to go against multiple btrs, a BMP, a tank, and the spandrel .Hmm we wouldnt have changed that, I'd that seen old bug? I was never aware, i can pass to qa and see if they know of itPublic Testing - The new daytime Mutaha Invasion v2 layer still has a noticeable ambient sound of crickets, is this intentional?MORE INVASION LAYERSWhy most of the map-layers are sunny?

On some maps it's just way too bright. (Moved it from v2-feedback)Can we not have to render the entire map on Skirmish Layers? Maybe just create a "lite" version of a city around it but it kills FPS on many people's machineson sumari invasion you gotta give the US more tickets when they cap... 50 aint it.. ive never seen the US win that layer everSkorpo. Sorry for the wait. I never learned the maps name. But Everytime facing the lake (north) my frames drop to the 30s and the same happens to many other players in the game.Crucible on mestia AAS v1 is an incredibly difficult cap to hold. There's little cover and vic farming spots on all directions, and the towers aren't great. I know it's been recently redesigned, but some kind of building or tunnel system with mortar-proof cover would make it an interesting/viable mid-cap. most pub games turn into fights over quarry or warehouse, which are good caps, but this only happens because crucible is such a ticket bleed to hold. the strat right now is to have control over either quarry or warehouse, whichever is the enemy cap, and only cap crucible when you're ready to cap the next flag. it makes for interesting games, but incredibly frustrating if you play in the normal 1 flag at a time progressionI just played some version of Talil (invasion, ins vs us) and the ticket count was so drastically off on a full server that we had 150 tickets or so by the second point from 900; maybe balance the maps a bit more?On Talil Invasion, you guys have to change the first cap point... Eridu and Mahatt Ur are not it.. at all.... I have never seen the US cap either point when its actually defended.. the only time ive ever seen it capped is when the defense decides to not defend to actually have a game that lasts over 15 min.... Make the first cap Ali air base or something.rebalance some of the layers of brits with ctas included,
sometimes it goes up alone against 3 btr's + bmp like goro v2, sometimes it + a regular warrior against a single bmp like fallujah
just feels off sometimesYeah this is a good suggestion ^^^^ 
Would also be nice to see more of MEA faction attacking insurgents on invasion layers1.Add more AAS and RAAS where 1 of the sides is Insurgents or Militia
2.Stop replacing faction on current layers and instead add more layer (v5,v6,v7 etc)
3.Add more Invasion layers with Insurgents as attackers and MEA as defendersPlease remove the Spandrel from Tallil Invasion v1. Attackers should always have asset superiority in invasion, but the spandrel on that layer tips the favor towards defenders. By simply removing that one asset, the map will still be a difficult (but rewarding) map to attack on, but will be a lot more balanced. Give them a regular BRDM/BTR-80 in replacement or just remove it completely. Alternatively could adjust other armor in order to keep the spandrel, but the spandrel is the main offender.Chora Inv v2: 2 diffrent flags are named `Mosque`, leading to confusionWhen CAF gets their new heli, yesneed heli in this layer gorodok raasv 2 caf because logistic on this layer is so bad a heli will be goodCAF al basrah invasion v2 doesn't make sense, it's MEA. And they get transport trucks instead of logi's, and only get small logi's. Also staging phase map border doesn't make senseINS is better than MEA for many AAS layersMore INS layers plsAt some stage in future updates it would be great to get some reworked Fallujah skirmish maps. This would be a great seeding map for servers but Skirmish v1 is too small for 100 player servers once numbers get up to 20v20 or more. Skirmish v2 is also a bit pointless with the two second caps being right beside each other and the middle cap off to one side.Goose Bay RAAS v1 the RUS main base zone cuts off at that point, leading to an awkward situation where you can't resupply logis at the repair station, you have to drive further down. At least 4 different people got confused and thought they were logi buggedthe fact that the entire map relies on "did we kill the helicopters" is bad meta for both teams, especially how unlike MBTs/other "long-term" assets, the helicopters can be carelessly blown up with a simple mis-click/mis-press of a key.Please take some time and watch actual games on Lakash but also other maps; look at player trends, and try to design the maps to cater towards those trends/tactics. Examples include how after the initial spawning, nobody on the larger-format maps uses the vehicles again because `it's miserable driving them on these maps`I'll take some time to give brief feedback: why would you make a map, with triangular pot-holes everywhere, and then give insurgents limited ways/means to get the vehicles to the main section of the map?INS Lakash or whatever is just bad. Whoever designed it just does `not` play it at allGorodok Invasion v1.
Remove helicopters for RU to balance the layer.Could you add to the server browser info about next map layer? It would make easier to choose server when most of them have queues of ten people or even more.In older versions, I could run Manic-5 with a decent Framerate, nowadays it's almost impossible.
There is something wrong!!It's not a map layer problem, it's a manic itself is bitch to runCAF Manic Invasion layer 2, with US invading and CAF defending is utterly unoptimized, my GPU was literally struggling to hold onto its performance. You cannot look towards the south of the map without frames dropping randomly.I would love to see more dawn/dusk layers :3 with some delicate fogIs there a new list of admin commands published anywhere?Re-add all of the INS layers you took out when MEA was added. 

This includes layers for maps; 
Kokan Valley
Sumari Bala
Logar Valley

There's too few layers with INS that are not invasion/insurgency and people love to play the faction.invasion*take the spandrel of talil v1 russians have it too easy beating the americansIt was legit a very good performance anti armor vehicle. Once i did with 3 man squad clearing everything on the west side of talil without survivor, killing 3 Abrams, 2 bradley, 2 logi, 2 mrap tow and countless Blackhawk and because of that they didn't want to go thereOr adding sprandel for the Russian

I don't know why the dev think simr kornet is weak or something, It has a very good performance of smallest vehicle even compared to technical with capabilities of killing the heaviest armor.Tigr RWS has a faster rate of fire than the TAPVs which helps immensely when trying to fight them head on. As far as the armor of the Tigr vs the TAPV, their armor is functionally identical. C6 LAV 3 can't even kill a Tigr RWS so I guess the Tigr is heavily armored then right?stll a tapv is on par if not better than a tigr rws so there should be at least two rws tigrs against 2 tapv's and a lav III. It still puts CAF at an advantage since they have 3 well armoured veh against 2 light armoured tigrsOn most layers MEA don't need the Simir Kornet if they have other heavier vehicles available but if Simirs are all they get then they'll always be at a significant disadvantage if they didn't have the Kornet.HAT kits shouldn't be the determining factor for vehicle balance but MEA doesn't have a good MATV equivalent. If all they had were Simir Kords vs MATVs they'd be at a significant disadvantage while the Simir Kornet has to sit relatively far away in order to be effective and even then it only takes one guy to decrew it.Remove the Simir Kornet and replace it with another scout car or something, just not a 1500m range missile that can kill anything on the map and that is more mobile than anything else in the game.

While on this subject, remove ATGM vehicles from most layers. They're awful and degrade gameplay both for infantry and for vehicles. Another alternative is instead of removing them, make it so that if you hit a Spandrel or TOW M-ATV with a sabot round they actually die instead of being set on fire.I don't know why the vehicle balance against MEA is always sort of even until you're like "yeah MEA needs something else... How about a Simir Kornet" It's totally unnecessary and like the other ATGM vehicles ruins vehicle gameplay. They don't need it, especially since the RPG-29 is quite literally a laser. Kohat RAAS v3 is a great example of this, Where it's fairly even until suddenly MEA gets the Simir with an ATGM slapped on the back of it:Logar Valley AAS v1

MEA gets a Kornet
US doesn't get a TOW MRAP

MEA HAT also gets 2 Tandem rockets.

Very balanced :thumbsup:The C6 LAV III is an M240 on top essentially. Not a 50 cal.**What is wrong with you?**

I have 2 layeres that are so unbalanced that its not even funny.

**1.**`Mesta RAAS v1 CAF`
You have literally a LAV III c6 RWS which is essentially a stryker with 2 m240 and 2 tapv's which are the better mrap crows against a single tigr rws which is extremely delicate because its really easy to kill the gunner and a open top which is even more delicate.
Also why would the rus just randomly receive an additional transport truck when they already have higher transport capabilities because of the tigr that can fit a full squad inside

**2.**`Kokan RAAS v1`
Oh so we get 4 mraps open top cool, but hold on. A mt-lb, 3 simir kords and a kornet? sounds intresting but the thing is the kornet one shots logis or mraps at the beggining and the mtlb can easly kill the mraps with simirs help and than even if we do kill enemy veh as us, the open top mraps are questionable at the least against infantry where as a mtlb is extreamly decent, because there is no way to take out the gunner unless you have a rocket

To me this sounds like two quite unbalanced layers that need a rebalance especialy with the kornet in kokanSkorpo Invasion v1, the randomized spawn of vics can put the spandrel on the southern spawn for MIL. When its at main, attackers usually have some time to push before it shows. But when it spawns south, it's in perfect position before staging ends. Skorpo is already a perfect map for the spandy, but keep it from spawning anywhere but main at the start plzRussia layer on fallujah (i want to see how the btr82a would fare in intense urban combat)Al Basrah Invasion v1


I think that the vehicles are a bit unbalanced here too.
I think a BMP-1 or a T62 for the Insurgents would be appropriate.
The SPG techies are way too fragileUS has a big disadvantage by not being able to confirm the map's lane until they backcap the 3rd flag unless it goes west to Shevchenko, while Rus can confirm the lane after the 1st or 2nd backcap. This means that Russia can more easily predict backcaps while being able to rush Novo or north Airfield to constantly harass the US rollout. Notice how on Yeho RAAS v3 and CAF RAAS v1 that the first flag for each team is already capped to help somewhat curb this blufor disadvantage.Yehrovika RAAS v1 is quite unbalanced, US have a big advantage because their first 3 flags are literary next to each other.theres a extra time for the defender at invasion layers maybe should just turn it to like v1What did you even say here?Dear Devs, 
I know that you have put a lot of blood sweat and tears into developing the BMP x Tree mechanic, but please please remove itFor Narva AAS V2 please change the 3rd cap for the Russians from Oru village to a cap closer to Russian main as the British always get there before the Russians.Rotate more maps. Let us have Zolota or Trudove as middle flags on Yehorivka for example. The battle is always on the same place. Many areas of maps are never explored.Please, add helicopters to Fallujah they are perfect for that map. I don't understand why they aren't there, roof top combat and quick helo drop offs are god tier.all the people complaining about invasion being defender sided are idiots and missing the entire point of invasion. The whole point is for defence to be able to get a good defence going and for the attackers to overcome and gather momentum. Although I do agree some of the points are pretty bad. I know on gorodok invasion v1 there is the possibility for Russia to get Desna. This allows them to set up a Kornet (which I have done and been very effective with) and basically kill vehicles going across the river. But defender still need more time than the attackers. Maybe for conventional vs conventional lower it a bit but it is very important for the nonconventional factions to be able to set up.Mutaha AAS v2, this seems a bit unbalanced for vics. Russia gets 2 BTR 82A while UK gets 2 Scimitars. The BTRs have more health, similar top speed, stabilized guns with high rate of fire + the recent AP buff, while the scimitars have the HP of a scout car, unstabilsed guns with low fire rate. The BTRs just shit on the scimitars and I think a possible fix is maybe add one warrior UA, which can still be killed by BTRs by shooting the turret but at least UK will have a chance to fight back unlike the scimitars. The BTRs can tank one Tandem and get away while scimitars just get instantly killedDefense has the advantage in Invasion hands down. The biggest problem is the layers, as they just have god awful first points. It's either:

A. First point is extremely far from attacker main and there's a lot of open ground with little cover in between

B. You can spit on first point from Attacker main. And the enemy is right there in between, spitting back at you. Probably into your open mouth.

90% of invasion games pretty much see the defenders winning in about 15-20 mins. Ideally, attackers and defenders should arrive at ROUGHLY the same time. It doesn't have to be down to the second, but no more than a minute between each teams arrival. That way defenders actually have to make a decision backed by consequences, rather than always being able to curb stomp attackers on first point.maybe for invasion  instead of staging phase maybe waiting for match to start? so attacker has more chance to win the iinvaisonFor gorodok RAAS V2 please give the British an LPPV as the Russians always back cap far faster due to having a BRDM. I know the British have a Scimitar but it is far slower than the BRDM and requires a crewman role which means you cant have two guys from an infantry squad grab it for back caps.Include USA and Britain to Manic-5 and Goose Bay.We need Invasion layer on Al Basrah and Fallujah where MEA AttacksSumari RAASv2 GB vs. MEA

GB: 3 Logis
MEA: 5 Logis

I think it would be more balanced if you swap the two small logis for a large transpoWould be nice to have talil RAAS for INS vs MIL.change spg to  bmp techie cuz most ins layers dosent get the bmp techieCAF fallujah raas v1 seems a bit one sided for the Canadians on armourAdd british and usa to goosebay layersYeho RAASv4 

A map border would be nice to make it clearer that the layout is only in the north.
In addition, an adaptation of the vehicles would make sense since the Russians only have two BTR-80 against two Stryker.
I think that's a little unbalancedYEHO RAAS v3 vehicle balance seems really in RUS favor!Add the CTAS to more layers, especially ones where the other team's armor includes a BMP-2. Right now quite a few layers on Yeho and Goro don't have it when it would be a worthwhile changethink the best strat for us is to rush refineryjust played this can confirm it was horriblePlease make Fallujah Skirmish v1 a daytime map, or give a version of it that's daytime. It's a good map for seeding and just fun gameplay in general, but the night time setting is suboptimal.or sumari tanks and heli xdCan we get a Goose Bay Tanks layer or two?Maybe reconsider this layer, where the distance between US's first point to their main is greater than the distance between their second point and MEA's main, and the center point is closer to MEA's main than their first point isFallujah RAAS v2 on  mea side logies on spawn are not in fob radius(cant load/unload)You're heavily exaggerating here. The main OBJs are Mohd Zai and Chakar Kot. Mohd Zai takes longer for the British to get there and Chakar Kot takes longer for the Russians to get there. That layer is an 8 point map though so neither of those are the "mid point".

Russian Main is on top of a massive mountain that gives you a ton of speed on your roll out and both factions have helis too so getting to your defense objective is nearly the same amount of time.

As to if the faction has the "best 4x optic" or not, that's entirely personal preference as to which one is better. Some people hate the 1P29 for INS and MIL while others actually enjoy it.

You clearly haven't used the NLAW if you think that it's lock on. Sure it has no drop until a certain distance but it's definitely not lock on. The Warrior CTAS is the **only** vehicle available to the British that can take out armor on the Russian team. Russia gets 3x 30mm BTRs **AND** a BMP-2. The only armor that the British realistically have is the CTAS and kind of the Scimitar, but that never wins a head on fight with only 1 30mm.

Also are you serious about having the weakest armor? Most people are in agreement that the 30mm is one of the best APC/IFVs in the game and the BMP-2 is no slouch either. Especially after the penetration buff.Kohat Toi RAAS V4 is extremely UK biased.  This first 4 obj's are within 500m of UK main with roads leading all the way.  Russians have to cross mountains and a river.  Ontop of this the UK is the strongest faction with the best 4x optic in the game for their standard issue, and a 3x optic for their support, lock on no drop missiles, and a 40mm apc with tank armour, whereas russians have a 3x optic standard, irons for support and the weakest armour in the game.  Context: Played this layer 15 times.  Half as Rus half as UK.  Every match has been a easy win by 300 tickets as brits.  Rus armour is weak because a BTR can be killed by 75% of a 50 magazine.  Glass cannon.  50 can even kill a BMP easily if the BMP sees no target.   British rifle is significantly better at range and CQB due to clarity, 4x and 3x, mildots, recoil.  UK HAT has 1mm of drop at 400m and therefore can snipe BTR or BMP at 400m easily in an open map with little cover.  Meanwhile Rus Hat has ironsights (useless on this map) slower missile velocity, and is difficult to be accurate beyond 300m if you dont have accurate ranging and if it does hit warrior takes 2 to kill whilst BMP and BTR is typically 1 at front or side armour.could the map boarders on the in game maps be clearly define for example maps like mestia give the illusion of being able to travel further out than you actually can <:starepray:760457980818096128>RAAS is useless with squadlanesas it is now, 2/3 lanes on RAAS can go CFB, with mid lane being 100% and eastern lane being 50/50. This means unless the map goes southwest lane, games tend to devolve into fighting over the same section of map.

If my math is correct, that means 50% of all RAAS games will be fighting over a CFB Goose Bay point. With my change, that number drops to 33.3%Goose Bay needs more midpoint variety so it doesn't always feel like it goes CFB. Here is a minor suggestion. make the shared middle/eastern lane CFB point (the one in the middle of the three CFB points) a strictly eastern lane point on the small outpost between CFB and Housing.
This would make middle lane have 2 points on CFB and eastern lane have 2 points NOT on CFB.Al Basrah Invasion V1 -- are you supposed to be able to cross the river here? (squad 7, east side of map)Hello, I have a problem with the map of Fallujah and mataha. When I press the Caps button to open the map, and before the map appears, I have one second pause before opening the map. This happened to me after updating the v2 version, and the problem still exists until now.You're missing the point. Not having a heli at the immediate start balances the rush meta by giving the defending team a chance to be at said objective before the attacker. On most layers it takes longer to reach your own second cap than for the attacking team to get there in a helicopter. If the attacking team doesn't have the opportunity to beat you to said objective then the rush isn't nearly as viable as it is now.On RAAS this generally isn't as big of a deal since a heli backcap rush could go to a completely irrelevant point unless it's something like Russians flying to Yeho AirfieldIt makes the heli rollout a centralizing factor to the outcome of games. Taking pubs into consideration, 1 team could luck out with 2 good heli pilots and the other team could end up with pepegas hogging the assets. In this (fairly common) case it will end up with the unlucky team getting stalled or even blocked on their back caps while the enemy team walks from point to point with little to no resistance. There is no way to stop this kind of rush in this situation unless your incompetent pilots can just yeet their helis into the enemy helis on rollout to prevent the rush completely, however that isn't allowed on most popular servers.But how is it different to without helis? A squad is still capable of grabbing a logi/MRAP etc and rushing a point
Meaning the opposing team still has those 2 optionsright but then you have to pick either 
1. rush the enemies point 
2. counter rushYour argument doesn't make much sense to me though. If both sides have Helis then they both have the same opportunity to get to the middle flag, just the same as opposing logies have the same opportunity. 
I understand a delay on helis if you're vs Insurgence, but otherwise the opportunity is equal on both sides.Except that it does. The alternative vehicles give plenty of time for the team getting rushed to get to said objective and be able to defend it. It takes a hell of a lot longer to get to Petrivka in a Stryker or Logi than it does to get there in a helicopter. You can still rush it sure, but it's not nearly as effective as it gives plenty of time for the defenders to get their own 30mm or Logi to said objective.But it doesn't, because people just rush with alternative vehicles.Got rid of AAS and only implement RAAS but then more random.albasrah invasion v1 ins only have bmp techie  its not balanced   atleast give them 1 bmp"Rush, but don't make it braindead easy" If you can only drive a logi or a 30 to the enemies second objective that gives plenty of time for the enemies logi to get to said objective. Nobody is going to use their own heli just to back cap the second objective."rush, but don't actually rush"AAS is all about rushing the objective. Making it so helis can't rush the mid point or the second point helps gameplay by nerfing the rush meta.Remove the heli delays on AAS layers. Helis are so integral to the game, and limiting teams especially on larger maps has no purpose. There's the mechanic where you can sneak cap with one person for a reason to counter a rush.Ignore it's Yeho invasion v2, but adding more points in these areas would be sort of cool, one new area for each lane Yehorivka has.I think more blue on blue layers (and not only CAN vs US) can be very good and very fun, as they are a nice change of pace, since 90% of the time as a bluefor you fight russian / MEA / insurgents
insurgent VS milicia are very fun too, IED and bikes exploding everywhere, we need more of thisWe need MORE layers with MORE factions, not replacing factions on the older ones. 
V1 gave us MEA that replaced Insurgents on a lot of AAS and skirmish layers instead of making new ones. Same story with pre V1 layers. For example old Goro AAS v1 Militia vs RGF was very interresting and funny and now it’s just boring USA vs RussiaUS vs Caf goosebayumm... <:facepalm:274960238673788928>Al basrah invasion would be awesome if there was like a skirmish version. No armour and in the city only. Some smaller invasion layers would be pretty fun.blowing up 'out of bounds' really suck if its on your map not out of bounds... Fallujah invasion v1So the layer has always been unbalanced to it's core
I say again:
> "Whoever made Sumari Invasion v1 needs to rethink their life choices."I’m just going to say that, that layer in particular used to be EZ win for USA. It’s been ever since usa cannot shoot out of main that main camping is ez (for all layers really). And defenders winning first cap is as a result of staging phase timer increasing, resulting in a MUCH more prepared first flag defence. Used to be that defenders  (typically) just arrived with seconds until round started, now everyone has time to rally up and get everyone spawned on the flagAnother different issue I've found is that on Al Basrah Skirmish v1, which we frequently use to seed our server, MEA main is hell to navigate and be efficient in. Spawning Vehicles in a building with one exit that doesn't even lead to a main road? What the hell? 

Just move it North to the highway! Extend the map borders for it if you need to. That place is hell to get Urals and even Scout Cars out of.Now, I don't like being critical and not giving constructive feedback, so here's my solution:

1. Move USA Main to where CAF Main is on AAS, reducing base rape.
2. Reduce number of Capture Points from 6 -> 4 or 5, meaning on this small AF map the INS are forced to be strategic with FOBs and reduces the chance that OBJs are right next to each other. (See Palace/Bakery in the screenshot)
3. Remove flags from the West/Northwest, away from new Main, add more flags on the Northeast. This allows USA to use the ground they gain to attack more effectively as the match proceeds, and prevents INS infantry defending a point to shoot at USA Main
4. Move the INS 2nd Main slightly back, from Police to Mosque, allowing US to potentially meet INS at first cap *before* defenses are set up, making for an intense first contact, that isn't just a slaughter of Americans.
5. Give USA a Stryker or M-ATV CROWS. INS already have insanely strong AT, so I'm 100% sure this isn't going to break anything.

I guarantee you that if you had data on every match ever played on this layer, INS win 98% of the time, because US can't even cap the first point.Whoever made Sumari Invasion v1 needs to rethink their life choices. It's the worst layer in the game and everytime I end up playing it I want to quit. INS can literally main-camp from the first 10s of the game, It's practically impossible for USA to get a foothold and push the first objective and their tickets bleed so fast that the game is over in 15mins which is the only redeeming quality of the Layer.

One of the first objectives (Checkpoint) is ***less*** than 200m from US main.Applies to basically every map in the gamethe west side of the map does need to be played moreThe first cap is very hard because of its positioning.The time is long enough for the Abrams to get almost any where it wants, but you might to be right.ture but it could just be that the first point can get moved further away from russian main so the russians have some time to get out and then still have mirrored vics also make perodove a second main with a logi so amercain cant camp there at the startthe only time i saw the russians get past the first cap was when the teams were stacked with clans on the russians, and we still lost on second or third captrue, thats why i said its not a good blalance yet, but it was worse beforei mean when the russians have a BMP-2 3 BTR-82 a T-72 and a spandrel, I dont think 2 bradleys are enoughbut i think this is closerthey also used to have tow mrap so there is probobly a medium, but neither are ito you have no idea how stoping it was that the americans had abramswell now its too easy for the russians without the american tank
i would rather have a challenge then a stomplayer was too hard with an american tank for the russiansYehorivka Invasion V2 the Americans need a tankidk if it would be viable but to maybe counter that the commander could get a new call in light light arty or mortars that will be available at the beginning to help the attackers soften up the targetsThe increased staging time has massively thrown off the balance on a large amount of invasion layers.  Now the attackers are met with a wall of enemies immediately, rather than just the forward spawners and fast vehiclesdestruction should be random the cache location not like the same place^^+++^ Or just add **more** layers instead of editing the current ones, so server owners have more to choose from.Suggestion: Sumari AAS v1, RAAS v1, RAAS v2, CAF AAS v1 be switched from MEA on the opfor side to either MIL or INS. Maybe even one of the layers to feature 2 Conventional forces just for fun.this is manic invasion v2 usa vs canadian, it looks greatly unbalanced. 2 MRAPS and 3 bradleys vs 3 lavs and 2 tapv?I mean The terrain is tough for vehicles on the map, but still 3 bradleys are op. in this case. I think at least there should be 1 bradley instead of 3 and a stryker or two could also be added.  Better suggestions are welcomed.Plus one of the logis and the ONLY SPG techi that INS gets don't respawn... I wanna play Insurgency more often, and believe in asymmetrical modes that attackers should have asset superiority, but this is extreme lolcan we get a tapv interior that doesnt look messed up, that thing is basically brand new and has only seen deployments in natural disaster zonesthat just punishes people who play medic
medic is an important roleeotech on CAF medic

medic shortages are common on CAF, and the eotech isn't on many very many loadouts

maybe take the eotech from LAT to give it to medicCAF Yeho RAAS v2: Thank you for adding more points west of the Mogilyovos and east of Bilovia. This portion of the map is criminally underplayed in the past.I am all in if we can choose them as characters. Smaller hitboxes <:kekw:735263519473139783>adminchangelayer CAF_Jensens_Range_v1 or something like thatgib canadian shooting rangeI think the old Arid pattern was better looking and actually looked like CADPAT. The updated version has better colours but a weird pattern thoughAs for feedback: Can we expect any updates on if/when we might see the LUVW that was leaked in patch notes back during the holiday season?

Otherwise, love the work you’ve done/been doing Baron!Multiple current and retired CAF members were consulted for the 2.3 update to the camo, obviously it’s not exact but as you are aware, being former CAF, DND can be pretty protective of our stuff when they chose to, so OWI probably wants to avoid potential licensing headachesAnd that current one got a passing grade? C'mon, we both use to wear the uniform, we both know the pattern size is still to small and too much brown.Cuz it's laptopOh you fell 50cm, better bandageFinally dear godUpdated falling damage and burning damage to no longer cause the player to begin bleeding.

Please keep it to feedback posts only. If you want to have discussions please take it to <#91294111071469568>, thank you!I understand your point but you cant force players on shadows and give them bad performance which mean disadvantage on gameplayThey still got timeYes, and I am hoping for them to address performance as best as they canPeople will also be at a disadvantage due to lower fps after 2.9I want the game to look as good as possible and no one should be at a disadvantageYes but it's a little nonsensical to have to put High settings and suffering a disadvantage. I do not want to be 'forced' to play on Low to be on a leveling playing field imo.Yes but if you feel that it’s unfair you can put settings in low and do the sameRegardless of what fps you would getThe "fair" part was about shadows themselfs, rn if you play on lowest you dont have shadows at distance so players above low couldnt see someone in the shadows very well but you on low could easily spot himAnd btw you said on the live chat that one of your goals for new shadows is to make it fair for everyone, i dont know how you think it’s unfair when everyone is able to use settings in low (from in-game settings) players use low settings to get better performanceGpu:1050 ti 4g vram

I have huge frame drops especially in Gorodok and yehorivka , when i open my scope i get 30 fps and 30m.s 
I have all settings on low , using 1920*1080 resolution , this test was offline, with full servers i am pretty sure that i will get worse performance, it’s too stuttering and unplayable for me , i used to have 60+fps in all mapsWhen can we expect this graphics overhaul will be released?ROGERRRRRRRI dont work on Hab proxy, only systems like shadows, probably the better place for that feedback is <#783084034460745772> or <#91294111071469568><@!138152262882164746> I know this doesn't have anything to do with shadows but pls for the love of god don't do a 80m proxy range. Maybe something like 50 but 80m is just crazy far.

Yes yes I know pingree, fucking Gareth again and all that. Anyhoo I got a reminder for y'all.

In approximately 1 hour and 45 minutes, <@!265589888580190208>  and a few others will be splitting y'all into different teams to be murderated by some salty toxic admins with smgs. I suggest you show up somewhat prior to that 1 hr and 45 minutes start time, so that we can in fact **start on time**. You can see the actual start time at https://codefourgaming.com/event-countdown/

Thats all I got, so ta ta for now

Gareth out <a:zRiggsLeave:747406662616350720>Hey noobs!

We've heard your complaints! As of now, there is a new measure for finding who have "gotten gud" on EU1. I won't go into the details about what it is, but it should hopefully prevent that one level 45 from going 100-0 every game. If you are that one guy, you are encouraged to now play on EU4 with the other tryhards. For those of you that are still noobs, please continue to provide feedback so we know if anything needs changed or adjusted.If you are applying to become a staff member or a member your private messages need to be turned on because that is the only way for me to respond to you about your application. There has been a couple people who applied and I am not able to message them at all or even add them because it says there not accepting friends at this time. Only apply if you are truly going to be active as well.<:c4g:364926789346131970> Welcome to the Code4Gaming Discord! <:c4g:364926789346131970>

Perfect time to do some events.IDK how possible it would be but carrier spawns for KOTH, like it would all be off the coast of one of the peninsulas and you would have to either spawn boats/jets/helos to raidI don't know if it would be possible on a technical level but an event that mixed some wasteland features into KOTH could be really interesting.

Moderately restrictive loadout and vehicle options at the buy screen but with some areas near-ish the AO that could spawn some higher tier vehicles and weapon crates that hopefully groups from each team would go fight over (maybe with a 1-2 minute warning that they were coming so people could get organised?).Whole zone is off the coast of the cam_lao_nam map. Gameplay would be centered around boat spawns, heli jockey fights in the air (hopefully trying to fight in hot zone), and teams securing the pillar islands in the zone.

It is wrapped around the grip itself and locks the grip into place when you engage the cruise control. That's how most of the aftermarket ones work. But this will also disengage if you hit the front brake.Interesting, do you just use your thumb to activate it next to the would be starter button?Fits Yamaha Roadliner 1996-2020

Which could have been easily replaced without taking it all out.Was a pain in the ass to put back together mainly because I had parts mixed in the bag he gave me from 2 other vehicles and not knowing how it came apart.previous owners doing.

Fill out the form below and we'll contact you if you are accepted. __Even if you were not accepted last time, please re-apply if you are still interested.__

Discord mods are responsible for keeping the <#500874281656516618> enforced and helping new users of the server. People who agree with our morals and spend a lot of time on Discord are ideal for this job. You can apply here:
https://forms.gle/qTvwiShWJYXjoyWt8

Thank you in advance <:salute:754839993054134372>Hello all. You might have noticed <@!372022813839851520> has been on the server for some time now. This is a bot that helps find out alt Discord accounts by checking them against some factors. While it has checked new members since its been active, we would like to go back and verify people that have been here since before the bot joined as well.

For this reason, we created the "Members" role. It serves as a marker for us to know who has been verified or not. To get the role as an existing member, use the command ``;verify`` in a channel, preferably <#815942568747335680> to avoid filling other rooms with bot replies. At the moment, getting the role is not mandatory, so I will not @ everyone. However, in the near future we will be forcing people without the role to go through it and I will let everyone know when that starts happening because a lot of people ignore these announcements if they are not mentioned in them. Our goal is to get everyone to verify so it would be very helpful if you did it on your own with the command.

Read more about this bot here: <https://altdentifier.com/>.

EDIT:
__Make sure the bot is able to DM you, otherwise you wont be able to verify!__I'm happy to announce that Discord accepted our request to increase our member cap to 250,000 members!
This is not a partnership program, there will be no changes to the way the server runs because of it. Thank you all for sticking with us even after all that pruning we did. <:salute:754839993054134372>Meet <@!850030395860320306> 
Its a custom bot developed by <@!150365138116018176> that will feed real-time SRP server info within Discord in <#533133945143951362>  so now you can check things like:
How many people are online on our servers.
If the servers are up.
etc.We have made small changes to the official servers. A custom shaders patch version of at least 0.1.68 (Build 1259) is now required to be able to play on the server. If you run a version lower than that, content manager will not allow you to join the server. If you already played on our servers this will probably not affect you, since that CSP version is required to run the map anyway. 

A nice thing that we can do now because of that is use extra CSP features and therefore allow players to teleport to certain spots on the map. You will need **at least** CSP version 0.1.69 for this feature to work though. To teleport, click on the light bulb icon in your chat app and then click on `Teleport to...`. This will open a new menu in which you can choose where to teleport to:

If you want to drive bayshore but are one of the people that crash in the first left hander after the tunnel, this one is for you. It is located after that turn and and allows you to drive bayshore southbound.

Useful for getting to the lower part of the map (Mirai) quick to cruise around there. Worth doing now that the latest version got rid of the shaking.

Not everyone has been there yet since it's a new part of the map that got released with the 0.9.1 version of the map.

Another day, another pack. We finally have some Civics back to wreak havoc on Shuto, along with a spanking new Evo V. Also, the clown who made the physics for the Spyker claims to have fixed most of his mistakes with this update, so do give it a chance.
But yeah, we'll now have to bid farewell to the RX-7 FD and the 944. We understand that a lot of you liked these cars and will very much miss them, but we have to respect the mod author's wishes about their content. 
Psy, hope to see you back soon, all the best with Uni. Study well <a:TohruThumbsup:536008740382572564> 
We apologise to Coli for not having solicited his permission to edit the 944 <:SubaDogeza:809131277096583218> 

Thank you, to Amy, Facundo, and Katyusha.
Special shoutout to those who helped at the last moment to get this release out on the road, you know who you are.

https://discord.gg/dPJHRqpDrugsSince the release of 0.9.1 there has been more work done on Shibuya in all fronts (models, textures and the roads themselves). You might have caught some images of that progress here and there on Discord but nothing was posted here, mainly because everything is still unfinished and fairly ugly. There will be more visually interesting progress reports once we got something cool to show you regarding Shibuya.

When it comes to the rest of the track, I have started replacing building textures with ones that use a more traditional shader technique instead of the monstrosity we were using before. Visually, the new textures are basically identical to what the current version uses (except some that are being redone with different details) but they should fix the major issue where buildings appear to have a faded, glow-in-the-dark look at night from a distance. The goal is to have clear contrast between the lit windows and the dark walls + to be able to see that from far away. The current version's skyline looks very dull at night. 

Another change was updating the 3D model of Tokyo Tower and lighting it up using proper emission maps instead of CSP dynamic lights. While the latter had a nice natural effect, the light would despawn making the tower dark from a distance. The new model fixes this problem. The same technique will be done on Rainbow Bridge too, since its lights also go out too soon and it looks dark.Its been quiet in here while bug fixes from <#538484443829239810> have been recorded and fixed, I think we're ready for a proper release very soon.Bayshore is now updated too, although not 100% since some materials are unique to it and thus missing textures. The current ones will be used in those few objects instead.
Also:
Missing specular highlights on cars from track lights are back.
Dynamic shadow workaround, meaning you will be able to use dynamic shadows on SRP without lights vanishing.Major update to the Yokohane area. Building UV maps have been fixed and all building materials have been upgraded to match the ones in C1, Shibuya and Shinjuku. Screenshots taken without new VAO baked. Bayshore will follow soon.

__Track Map__
https://imgur.com/Iya1Q5l**Shutoko Revival Project v0.9.1**

**Changelog:**
__Areas__
• Added Shinjuku route (Route 4) from C1 all the way to Shinjuku railway station.
• New ground level junction in Yokohane to be used as a turnaround point.

__Gameplay__
• Added Yoyogi PA spawn point and layout.
• New and fixed minimap.
• Added random bumps and imperfections to the roads to make driving more interesting. Bear in mind it is still pretty rough because of the 32bit physics engine and SRP's size. A fix is being worked on by CSP.
• Removed some unnecessary barriers.

__Visuals__
• All new building materials and textures as well as improvements to materials and textures throughout the track.
• Added more landmarks from WWMT5 in Yokohama.
• Added animated trains and ships - Special thanks to Raildriver for train info.
• Fixed 100s of graphical issues. - Many thanks to our testers. Special thanks to Obammy.
• Shibaura PA visual enhancements.
• Fixed building UV maps in Yokohane and Bayshore.
• Added more realistic fireworks spawns across the whole track.
• RainFX support.
• Many lighting and track config fixes.
• Fixed missing specular highlights on cars from track lights.

__Misc__
• Drag and Drop installation support. Just drag and drop the 7zip in your Content Manager.

__Performance__
• Drastic performance improvement.
• Updated physical mesh.
• Updated collision mesh. 
• New LODs throughout the track.

__Known bugs__
• Due to what we think is a CSP issue with reflections, adjustments were made to building materials. As a result, glass buildings have blurry reflections.
• Building materials look faded and blurry from a distance at night.

__FAQ__
• Do I need to delete the older version(s)? No but if you're having checksume errors, do it.
• Where did the Time Attack layout from the PTBs go? You can get it from <#826392994469904394>  
• How do I install this? Just drag and drop this on Content Manager (or place the folder in your tracks folder). More info in <#504109102767669256>**Shutoko Revival Project official freeroam multiplayer servers**

Installation:
• Download a copy.
• Open the file using 7zip.
• Go into the "SRP_Car_Pack_2.7" folder.
• Extract the "content" folder in your main AC folder.
• Overwrite if prompted.

Bugs with the cars need to be reported to their authors you can find in the car's UI in CM. We do not make the cars.**Shutoko Revival Project v0.9.1 Shibaura Traffic Layout**

This is an optional layout for the main SRP track. Its an updated version of Gunja's AI released here. The only changes are the folder structure/ui compatibility with the current SRP version. 
Updated with permission. 
All credit goes to him.

•__What this does__: Lets you use AI opponents that act as traffic on SRP
•__What this does NOT do__: Include generic traffic car models like trucks. You need to find those on your own. They are not in this Discord.

It supports AI going around most of the track using CSP's AI Flood feature. The pits are located in Shibaura PA.

__Features:__
• 32 pits.
• AI Flood support.

__Installation:__
• Drag and drop on Content Manager.
• Click install.

__Requirements:__
• You need to have the main SRP track from <#500247010184527873> 

__Warnings:__
• **For some reason, the latest CSP version is missing some settings needed for this layout to work. __Use CSP 0.1.73 instead.__**
• **Look at the included settings (open the archive and look for the settings folder). Make sure you are using the right settings as shown in the image. Otherwise your AI will stop on the road.**
• **Loading this can take upwards of 10 minutes on an SSD. Just let the game load, dont click on it because it will say its not responding. If it does just let it be, it will load eventually.**
• Dont use too many AI cars. 6 is a good number.
• Obviously Assetto Corsa AI is not made to work like this. There will be bugs but there's nothing that can be done right now.

9. Links-You can only post links in Mia gifs and videos and other servers including NSFW. If you want to self advertise a discord server do it in the right channel and that includes self advertising. Please do not DM advertise other discord servers. You can send links to other media E.G: Onlyfans ect. but they must follow the rules and if you want to partner servers please DM an admin6. This Discord server should NOT be used for therapy
Do not use this Server as a means to replace professional help, the users, mods and other staff are not able to help you with what you are going through. While you will not be punished you will be asked to please move your discussion somewhere else to talk about it. This also includes love birds to stay away from this server but if you are joking than that's fine. Even if you're not joking do not prolong that type of conversation to great extent it's kind of annoying and people might suspect something sus

7. Please follow the Discord TOS (https://discordapp.com/terms) as well as the Discord Guidelines (https://discordapp.com/guidelines) while you are on the server.  IF you are caught Breaking Discord Terms Of Service and Discord Guidelines will get you instantly banned. 
This means any kind of illegal activity on the discord to users or in the server, any kind of scamming or sending anything malicious to users. Do not use our server as a place to commit or threaten crimes such as DDosing or Doxxing. This will not be tolerated. (This means do not leak any of anyone’s private information) This also means forming raids, inside the discord or on the discord will lead to instant bans as well

ALSO Raiding will lead to Permabans as well and IF ANY attempts of taking down this server with anything against the TOS will result in Permabans and could possibly result kicks/bans to any person with connections to them. This server will not allow new members at this time indefinitely

--->Also I feel like I should make this clear as well: *DO NOT POST ANYTHING AGAINST THE TOS MOST NOTABLY  *G O R E*  **IF YOU ARE CAUGHT POSTING EITHER YOU WILL GET BANNED OR PERMABANNED YOU WILL BE IMMEDIATELY PERMABANNED IF YOU POST GORE NO EXCEPTIONS, EXCUSES OR QUESTIONS ASKED**<---Hello!

The below rules have been carefully selected to help you enjoy your stay on the server, even if you may disagree with some of them the moderators have selected them for you benefit. If you have any questions about the rules you may Direct Message a Moderator or Admin about them and if you see somebody breaking the rules please message a Moderator or Administrator. 
**Keep In Mind This Server Is NSFW**

R U L E S:
1.  Be respectful to other members on the server. We are all here for the same reason so let’s treat each other as we want to be treated ourselves. Do not use any  kind of derogatory slurs. Images included.
Do not target and harass members. Any kind of repeated insults and harassment will be met with punishment. Don't use this server for dating or joke about it. Do not be racist or homophobic at anytime, we are a welcoming discord of all

2. Do not spam  – This applies to text chat, voice chat, or via DM’s (to Administrators, Moderators, or other members ), as this will result in being muted and potentially banned from the server. Any Copypastas, Ascii art, entire song lyrics, movie scripts, or large series of individually sent messages also apply here

3.  Voice Chat Rules - Mic Spam/Ear Rape will result in a mute, if you want to be able to talk you should use the mic normally

4. Any form of avoiding punishment such as creating new accounts will result in a ban. Refrain from using alternative accounts in the discord.  Any kind of lying/forging of evidence to frame another member is completely unacceptable and will result in greater punishment towards you, most likely a ban

5.  Porn Genre's - Do not post under any circumstances post child porn, toddlercon, or anything similar to these two. Also do not post loli, shota OR G O R E its against Discord TOS. Doing so will be an instant ban@everyone https://twitter.com/MiaMalkova/status/1353780259766857729I would like to thank you all for 1000 Members!Happy new years @everyone! I wish u guys are doing well and spending time with family/friends and lets all hope for a better upcoming year for 2021! <:Grin:788175615152226324>Take this booty pic as an apology 
Update FYI: Connections problems again for some reason screen-share has bad quality 12/12/2020We will begin streaming Mia Malkova for 30 min shortly @everyone go to VC Stream NSFW Room
Edit: Bad Internet might try again laterUpdate from Mia Malkova:
Hello everyone! I'm still working on my comeback, looks like it needs to be postponed 
maybe another 2 weeks! When I'm back streaming I'll be streaming all the time again.

Be sure to follow Mia Malkova on twitch here and turn on notifications to never miss a stream: https://www.twitch.tv/miamalkova@everyone Another important announcement I have added a new feature to the server that I think you guys would like! 
**VIP Role** 
This role gives you access to more of our server channels where you get more content including more porn bots and I will post more Mia Malkova content!
You might be wondering how YOU could get the VIP role? Well there are 3 ways of doing so:
1. Become an active Member: Reach Level 4 on Mee6 You can check all the members levels at the dashboard: https://mee6.xyz/leaderboard/765999163019624489
2. Invite: Invite 10 people to get role
3. Boosting: Boosting the server once gives you the role permanently along with the Server Booster role.
Create an invite click our server name in the top left, and it should be highlighted in blue below: Invite People select that. You can Invite ur friends or create a link to do so.
*Fyi: If you are inviting other people to this server **ASK** if they want to join to the server than you can invite them*@everyone New Rule: Please do not dm other members or type in the chats "dm me me guys for free nudes" I'm aware that people are getting friend requests and dms from said people. It's annoying and we all know there either bots trying to promote there site or real people who are just desperate to get validation. If any members are getting dms from these people block them and dm me or a mod like <@!721426208268746813> or <@!480519411233587222> and I can put a stop to them.The bots are back online@everyone I have decided it might be better if I started streaming on Sundays after No Nut NovemberMore bot commands are being updated**Dank Memer:** <#768997144836440064>

https://forum.truckersmp.com/index.php?/topic/92640-scs-blog-a-look-back-at-2019/Suggestion: Add Groovy bot
What I mean: When some people are talking on the voice channels threy can command which song they want
This bot wil be useful also when people are driving together and want to listen to music when are driving 
Sorry for my broken English**Suggestion:** Post a "Save the date" message in <#720400776366653490> for upcoming TMP events.

**What I mean:** Let someone post dates of upcoming TMP events in <#720400776366653490> (and pin it) so everyone knows there will be an event at a specific date, so people can put it in their agenda for example.Suggestion:Make the new police car skin as a emote.
What i mean:Currently we have a new policecar skin and in my opinion it should be an emote here. (we already have the UK one, i mean the other one)<a:ukpolice:857018621338320927> <:ukpolice2:857018712572690452><a:uspolice:857018439678689280> <:uspolice2:857018531245850636>Due to high downvotes rate, we are not going to rename those channels for now.Not possible with how discord names the channels. All spaces are replaced by **-** and **/** isn't allowed to be in channel name.<#808303834463338503>**Suggestion:** Adding AltIdentifier bot
**What I Mean:** Can we add the AltIdentifier bot please? Lately it seems that more and more alt accounts are joining just to harrass or be horrible to members, I’m sure staff know what I mean by that. Sure it will add 1 extra step to joining but it might be worth it? But I understand if we can’t <a:SadCat_10:781546930295406632>Unfortunately we aren't going to proceed with this suggestion, as this would clog up the voice channel section with unused channels. We have over 13 voice channels publicly available + an option to create your own temporary private channel, therefore the suggestion is going to be declined.This emote was declined recently and this one has even worse quality, therefore won't be added.This already exists as a feature of the <@379996627764641792> bot. Use +help in <#336792115780780033> for more information. Under [Voice Channels] section.**suggestion:** thonk emote
**what i mean:** this just explain itself**Suggestion:** Temporary / Private voice channels that users can create simply by joining, it is auto deleted when no one is present

**What I mean**: I saw the suggestion above and it made me think of a bot that adds a voice channel called "Click to Create" or something and it creates a new VC and moves you into it, from here you can choose who is allowed to join and rename it. These calls are automatically removed when no one is in the VC. 

Instead of having language channels which can clutter the discord, or too many voice channels that people don't use - you can just have one - and let people create their own.

There are a few bots that do this so I will include a few:
<https://www.veebot.app/>
<https://top.gg/bot/715621848489918495>
<https://top.gg/bot/711149977472204851>Suggestion: Voice Cannel's for different languages
What I mean: The different language rules unlock the Text channel and some voice channels too. Maybe 3 voice channels because some peoples want to speak with his friends instead to speak with unknown users.
Disadvantages: It can be a big channel list because of the many languages. This mean it can be take a long time to set up this. This mean it's okay if this suggestion will be declined.
I decline it too.Please read my response above.Suggestion: call 
**What I Mean:** 
That if you closer to another user the volume higher and if you go away than go the volume lower and a setting that you can turn in or off that functionIf **this is a game Suggestion**, then please put it in the correct place, which is our forum (<https://forum.truckersmp.com/index.php?/forum/850-new-suggestions/>) . This channel is only used for **Discord-related** suggestion.**this is a game Suggestion**
**-Suggestion:** A Driver Licence system,
- points on the licence in Real Life (lets say if you get more than 3-6 points on your licence you get banned for 2 weeks) as an example, then it gets reset after 6 months
**What i mean:** Since TruckersMP is Starting to change and are wanting to get the more of the Real life experience i would think that maybe you would
try and add a drivers licence into the game**Suggestion:** Rename <#610574116105355398>  to <#307485773991510017> and <#307485773991510017> to <#307485773991510017>-chat
**What I Mean:** 
More people will intuitively go to the knowledge base first instead of going to the chat directly, asking the same questions as everyone else. This would free up the chat and make it easier to check whether someone else had the same problem.**Suggestion:** More discord perks for Patreons
**What I Mean:** Yes, There are some stuff In Game for Patreons, including a special tag, **Very rare** patreon convoy, Alternating Vehicles etc. But there is only 2 text channels, and a never used voice channel. Maybe something like what TruckersFM server does, is weekly movie nights, or monthly games nights. *and not really todo with discord, but more patreon convoys. (I will make a feedback ticket on this*)Due to high downvotes rate and the opinion behind the emote itself, we aren't going to add it.Due to high downvotes rate, we aren't going to proceed with this suggestion for now.At this moment in time, we don't see a good reason to add this feature, with many useless channels that wouldn't be used. If you want to discuss anything specific to a certain game (Euro Truck Sim 2 for example), you can use <#307435538980536321> channel.Same reason as above ^^^.Same reason as above ^^.Same reason as above ^.Due to high downvotes rate, we are not going to add this emote.The emote has been added <a:truckingconvoy:853578908486074398>.Suggestion: Truck fan channels 
What I Mean: you select your favourite truck like at language chats and take acces for the fan channel of the brand
It will make a community and will help the guys who love same truck to talk easier**Suggestion:** Add a channel for Aviation.

**What I Mean:** add a channel so that people that love aviation can chat with others that love aviation as well.**suggestion**: you should just add this, it just makes sence
**what i mean**: this just explains itself**Suggestion:** You should add this emote of a cat smiling weirdly
**What I Mean:** It's a cat with a smiling face but it could be used for awkward situations or for people who just wanna use it in their sentence + it's comes in handy when you don't have discord nitro**Suggestion:** Add this cool emote so you can assert dominance
**What I mean:** add this to your post to make it look badass**Suggestion:** Add thonk emote
**what i mean:** Its a useful emote**Suggestion:** Add balakan countries to the roles 
**What I mean:** is I think you should add all the balakan roles to the nationalities roles like Latvia etc**__Suggestion__**: could you add this as an emoji?
**__What i mean__**: its coolWe are not going to add this emote for the simple reason of being extremely poor quality, no matter if that it's intended appearance or not.**Suggestion:** Add new server emoji

**What I Mean:** Please add this picture as an emoji for people who want to apologise, the graphics is poor but that is the pointI will only link my resopnse here and not repeat myself again. https://discord.com/channels/307433337126125568/579644194604318730/847402827525521408 This isn't a channel to suggest in-game suggestions.Suggestion: Ability to change our voice channels name which can be created by <@!379996627764641792> 
What I mean: aboveAccepted, <#815921115473248266> is now an announcements channel, you're able to follow them to receive news on your own Discord Server.Any in-game related suggestion such as mod add-ons should be suggested on our forum in the 'New suggestions' section. We are not looking to change this process anytime soon.**Suggestion:** Have a mod-suggestion channel for atleast one Server.
**What I mean:** For example to have cool Beacon mods.Duplicate suggestion: https://ptb.discord.com/channels/307433337126125568/579644194604318730/835570331891925023
This is currently under review.**Suggestion:** Move the <#815921115473248266> channel into the "NEWS" Category
**What I mean:** Move the Chat in the "NEWS" Category as this is actually not a channel to chat but more like an announcement channel.
And in combination with Adrianus' suggestion it will be perfect.**Suggestion:** Make from the <#815921115473248266> a announcement channel

**What I Mean:** so we can share that update in our own discord channels<:kappapeek:736173191952597062>Having discussed this with Community Management, we will trial this idea most likely at the start of next month. If we see that the channel is used for it's intended purpose, it'll remain. Otherwise we'll remove it after the given time frame.The suggestion has been accepted and is currently in works by our Media team. The emotes are going to be added soon.**suggestion:** Pog emote
**what I mean:** you can use it when you see you a moderator,  friend, and othersPlease do not send questions like this here. The suggestion has been reviewed and is currently work in progress. Next time please use <@595878474523082754> bot for such issues.Suggestion: May or may not have been missed? 

What I mean: you may have missed this or you may not have missed it

What I Mean: Suggestion: In ATS/ETS 

What I Mean: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=652225351 we need this for realism it has alot of cool tech and interior stuff that's hella cool ive used it in my game works fine. all of the electronics have working maps and gps selectable and everything you can even select to have it view your truck stats (imagine looking at a mounted tablet on your dash at your trucks current stats)Please create game suggestions in the appropriate forum section. This channel is only for suggestions regarding this Discord server. Thank you.**Suggestion:** In ATS/ETS, AFK rest area 

**What I Mean:** Used the game's rest parking lots for like afk parking lots, so make players ghost to avoid any possible accident and make players in AFK mode 
(to go to eat for example or when your parents ask you to do something and etc)We already have a channel for advertising VTCs <#307533579150426112>, therefore we are not going to create another channel just for trucksbook, especially due to the fact we aren't associated with it either.**Suggestion:** Channel for sending our company on trucksbook
**What I Mean:** Channel where you can send a link to your company on trucksbook+stats+statshuh?Sorry, I am not sure what that game or server is.

I have seen on Facebook iberia is required, but also other people say its not

Do I need it?Does anyone know why convoy routes have 90 limiter?because many people only buy the base game to be trolling other players and chose this region for itwho knowswwhy is the calais duisburg road so popular?Mission successful of arguing for no reason other than because I'm bored <:PepeLaugh:716005423978643537>But then I got bored of not being able to use my feet to change gears past the 6th gear <a:NODDERS:798086687297110046>For most it's natural once you are used to it I even did kirkenes quarry road for a while with a 12+2 Scania <a:aPES_GaGun:666321871125348359><a:NODDERS:798086687297110046>Just don't get where you say you know how to shift then say 12 speeds in ets are difficult or what ever it wask, then leave it at that<a:NODDERS:798086687297110046> I am, never said your not allowed to use your method or mineWe have a different approach on the game, so let me do that how i want it to beHm yes because that definitely is the caseIn game that is as I assume we are on about that <a:NODDERS:798086687297110046>dudeBecause it's not<:Hmm:583105066349887488> if you know how to shift why are you making it to be such a big dealyou literally need half a minute for two linesI know how to shift, in ETS there just are enough other buttons already and most trucks would be automatic irl to, so yeah<:Hmm:583105066349887488> oh no he's been typing for more than 5 seconds<a:NODDERS:798086687297110046>It's literally just 1 button after some time and changing gears is not that hard even every 10kph?Then deal with a button being bound to change sets instead of complaining about itnoI play ETS2 to get my mind of<:Hmm:583105066349887488> then pick the 6 speedLet´s just say, I want my buttons for other things and don´t want to shift up every 10km/hIt's not that hard <:Wokege:852214881607352400>Also you on about doing 12 gears in a manualAs without someone saying something obvious about in game my context shifts me to irl<:Hmm:583105066349887488> I literally said I assumed as what natu said not youWell, I don´t know anyone here, so maybe, but why would I want to talk about irl in ETS2 channelEven then Id hope ets2 has a automatic where you can control the gears if needed <:Wokege:852214881607352400>As I think natu drives trucks irl <a:NODDERS:798086687297110046><:Hmm:583105066349887488> well I assumed natu was talking about their irl trucking aboveIf people can´t even figure that out, Imma head outAnywaysIt was about ETS the whole timewe never talked about irl<a:Allsmiles:617457196304695327><:Hmm:583105066349887488> did I miss the part where you swapped the topic back to ets2 or did you not get the memo about irl trucksdude, I just want to drive, not make it my full time job xD Also maybe, but I use realistic automatic and let it do it´s thing. _For people with normal loads on fitting trucks this works fine_<:Hmm:583105066349887488> it's called Google maps and you realise most automatic trucks either let you manually picks gear hence the "pick a lower gear for higher RPM" or if they're new enough they sense their load and adjust their shifting points accordinglyIt´s fine if you like to drive on the limit, but it´s not for meafter 100km of hoping there´s no gradientYou can get a truck that weights 60 tons to 90kmh with no problems with 490hpAlso, that's my frickin point... Under 600hp is just not enough for some loads. bUt If YoU pLaN yOuR rOuTeS aNd dRiVe MaNuAl In A tRuCk WiTh FrIgGiN 12 gEaRs, YoU cAn cRaWl yOuR wAy AnYwHeRe...I don't know how hilly that one specific street gets, unless it's one of the ones that I drive 50% of the time.As if I remember all of Europe like it was my left pocketDudeIf your truck can't make it you shouldn't take the loadAll you have to do is put it in a higher rev gear and not let off easy as<:Hmm:583105066349887488> it's called planning your route, if your truck can't take a hill don't take it on a hill simple as.Never said it's about speed for me, since I don't go 110 everywhere, it's just much more relaxing if your truck doesn't have to slow down because of some random hill. (at least for me)Don't enable pings for a useless reply <:Hmm:583105066349887488>https://tenor.com/view/bruh-really-tell-me-more-no-way-wth-gif-21239271This ^ news paper doesn't say about who asked<:Hmm:583105066349887488>I installed FH4 yesterday lmaoOr play Forza or something <a:NM_peepoNopers:761364872897495081>I just wanna deliver the goods u know xD<a:NODDERS:798086687297110046>If you want speed play kerbal space programA trucks about torque and what it can move, not how fast it can goIf you want speed play mf F1 2021 lmaoPeople thinking a truck is about speed is <:FeelsCringeMan:709602272300105738>Of course, but if I can choose between going 60 or slower on a highway/one lane street and may cause traffic problems and just go 75 to 90 all the time, I won't choose the slow variantYeah gotta be safeAnd I go max 90kmh so <a:rengeShrug:662222166326247434>Yeah that’s trueYou need to expect trucks to slow down when going uphill. It's going to happen, like it or notI don't expect trucks to be fast. So there's your answerSlow though?And there's literally nothing you can do about itWow dude, chill. Of course it's possible and you will get up most hills if you don't have to stop, but I'm not really digging it going on a highway with 60 or less, which can pretty much happenNot yet but you will in the future15-20 tons is quite light and you can tow them with under 500hp with 0 problems. If you can't, the problem is in the driver, not the truckI've towed 76tons with 520hp with no problemsdo i need iberia to play promods ?anyone wanna truckGood morningAlthough it was also taken on the ProMods mapThat's a matter of personal opinion you're describing, the fact is still that it's explained in the product description and its up to each person to decide if they consider it to be worth it or notIve looked at a freeware dc 3 for msfs 2020 and although being a freeware , it should be considerd as a payware , all buttons and knobs work , custom sounds , custom gtn 750 ( i think coz ive never used  msfs 2020, i just spend my time looking at the addons )So "utilising" should never be there... 777 needs a totally different system
Its not expensive at all coz its just considerd as a **skin** for the 747
Tbh , its just a 747. Also the physics are stolen from the 747....yes it doesnt fly like a 777.
The cockpit instrumemts ( some of them ) do not work and thats the least feature needed if youre paying a good price for it.... also forgot to mention , the fmc was also stolen from the 747
The only thing good about it is the exterior.....and the ff is far and away a better aircraft that ive seen and heardwhich was the same variants CS had$250 for just the CS 75 with all variants and options. I paid $162 for XP11 AND all variants of the FF 75 at the timeAin't commenting about the rest as I know nothing about it <:Shrug:750418459061518477>with msfs Im more irked at the fact that they went after painters tbh. But the 75 pisses me off royallyThe 300 is actually even cheaper the last time I checked and actually not expensive at allActually when it comes to the 777 for MSFS it's stated on the product page that it utilises the 747 cockpit and I wouldn't say anyone should expect to be able to buy a study level jetliner for the price that the 200 and 300 are sold for so I wouldn't necessarily call them a scamTo charge the amount they do for the level of product they have should be criminal...then the pricing for their little addon stuff is insane to top it off. Thats just p3d
Msfs they make a 777 that is essentially the 74 and say "good enough"then threaten to sue painter making liveries. I paid for Xplane and FF 75 with all variants for less than I would the captainsim with all variants and got a better aircraftWhy is it a scam tho? <:feelsthonkang:472726169981026315>Is the L1011 from CaptainScam good? $50 and the screenshots show a pretty good looking airplane but obviously its CS so it might not bePlease tell me you did not support captainscamshould be X Plane 11YesIs that flight simX-Plane 11, it's just a livery for the Zibo 737 mod thereThat southwest planeGet what?How do you get that <@425635083278483457>Ahhh intresting i will definitely be doing this thank you<@724647812150591559> unless they changed it yeah. When I first started I spent hours just parked inna cessna at the ga ramps at jfk and boston during events and just listened to comms, no one will have an issue as long as youre out of the wayYeah I use that but FlyTampa EKCH overrides that with better fully custom texturesI have a suggested addon
Download misterx6's airport environment HD 
It will replace all ground textures , runway textures etc.. with real life texturesFFA350 w/ PBR cockpit mod, Reshade, XPRealistic Pro, FlyTampa EKCH (although my installation of it is messed up and it doesn't display correctly), Traffic Global, X visibility, vivid sky, ASHA. I think that's all the addons in that videoonce i got that out the way and got familiar to the photo mode and filters, i knew my way around stuffi only needed the motivation to get the mods and start playing lmaothanks brodamn.. that lighting tho. looks amazingthank youHotyes indeedAssetto?already like this more than forza lmaoRX-7 FD RocketBunnyPorschea own police would be coolwhere would one find that trailer?How do you get a Telsa semi is it a mod in the workshop?Hey guys is a modding question so.

**Heat level system for the robber**
> Everyone will start off with heat level 1. In order to level up you need to win as the robber. You can also lose heat level by getting busted on your round. Starting from heat level 2 you will earn an xp bonus that will sum up with the already existing 100% xp bonus for winning the match. You can earn from 25% up to 100% more XP based on your heat level. Max heat level is 5, which will give you 100% XP bonus. Time in which EMP and AI blockades are enabled will also change based on heat level. The higher the level the faster the EMP and AI blockades will be enabled. On heat level 2 they will be enabled after 4 minutes, on heat level 3 after 3 minutes, on heat level 4 after 2 minutes and on heat level 5 after 1 minute. You can see/check your heat level next to minimap on your robber round, in menu robber stats submenu and also on playerlist.

**Airsupport EMP**
> Implemented electromagnetic pulse(EMP) for airsupport. Airsupport will now be able to use EMP, which will be enabled when the match timer hits 5 minutes. It can’t be used if there is any other cop near the robber. In order to use it you will need to be close to the robber, have visual on him and you will need to hold **aircraft fire** control for 5 seconds, which by default is **SPACE** or **RMB**(right mouse button) and for gamepad **A**. It can be cancelled by not holding the specified key. It can and will cancel itself if you lose sight of the robber or if you are not close enough to him. EMP can be used 3 times in total per match. If cancelled, it won’t count as used and the times that you can use it won’t decrease, but it will go on 1 minute cooldown. If used successfully, it will go on 2 minute cooldown and the times that you can use it will decrease. By successfully acquiring an EMP lock on the robber, the robber vehicle will be undriveable for the next 5 seconds and everyone except the airsupport itself will be notified about it.

Turns out there is no issue with the chat text at all. If your chat was hard to read and it looked like in the picture then it is because of your windows settings. To make it more readable you can go to "Adjust the appearance and performance of Windows" and enable "Smooth edges of screen fonts".@here
**UPDATE**

**Vehicle select**
> To lower the waiting time before the start of the match cops will now be able to select their vehicle right after the robber selects his vehicle. Robber will be able to customize his vehicle while other cops will be selecting their vehicles.

**Chat**

**Bug fixes**
> Fixed patron xp boost
> Fixed cop countdown. The last "GO" after 3, 2, 1 was not being displayed for cops**Chat**
> Chat has almost never been changed since the beginning of this server. Previously it was on top left corner of screen and it was overlapping with menus and help text box. We have changed chat theme to gtao like chat. Now it's in the middle on the right side of the screen and it's background is transparent. 
> Added /show command to show chat. The /hide command now only hides chat.

**Main menu stats**
> Now you will be able to view your stats like level, total wins, total games played, total time played from the main menu "Stats" sub menu.
> You will also be able to view separate stats like total wins, games, time played as a cop (including airsupport) and the same stats from your robber games.

**Respawning**
> Previously you had to type /r or/respawn command  to respawn. Now there is no longer any command for respawning. You will have to hold key that you usually use to exit vehicle, which by default is F and for controllers Y. By holding down the key respawn progress bar will appear on the right side of the screen and start to fill up, when it's filled up you will respawn.

**Option to toggle GUI**

> By default the key combination is set to SHIFT + G, on controllers A + RB.

**Discord nitro booster bonus**
> You will now receive 5% XP boost for boosting our discord server.**Robber blip**
> Robber blip will now be always delayed 6 seconds unless someone will have sight of him. As soon as someone will have sight of him his real blip will appear and the delayed blip will disappear until every cop looses sight of him again.

**Airsupport queue**
> Previously there was no queue for airsupport. Airsupport was chosen randomly from the in game players who had checked airsupport in their settings.
> Now we have brought queue for airsupport too, which will work the same way as the robber queue. You will still need to check airsupport in your settings. As soon as you will do that you will be added to the end of airsupport queue. If at some point you will be first in airsupport and robber queue at the same time, then you will be chosen as the robber, but you wont loose your airsupport queue position and you will be able to play it next match.**Vehicle select**
> Previously robber vehicle select worked the same way as vehicle select for cops. Now robber has to select and customize his vehicle before everyone else. He will be given 1 minute to select his vehicle and another minute to customize his vehicle. Robber can confirm his selected vehicle and customization any time before the time goes out. When the time is over or robber has pressed confirm it's time for cops to select their vehicles the same way as it worked until now. When 80% of cops have confirmed and time until the start of the match is more than 5 seconds then the time until start of the next match will be set to 5 seconds.
> 
> **Cop vehicle lock**
> Previously cop vehicles were locked based on player level and robber level. Now cop vehicles will be locked based on player level and robber's selected vehicle level. For example if robber selects level 3 vehicle, then cops wont be able to select any vehicle higher than level 3.
> 
> **Customization**
> **-** We have brought more donator only vehicle customization options for robber:
> Window Tint
> Headlight Color
> Wheel Smoke Color
> 
> **-** Color customization has been split into primary and secondary color
> **-** Wider color variation for robber
> **-** Added dark red and blue color option for cops
> 
> **Other**
> Currently selected/owned vehicle/customization option item will be disabled and shown as owned like in original los santos customs.
> Most customization options now can be viewed before selecting them@here
**UPDATE**
It's been quite a while since we had any big update and this one is actually the biggest one yet. You might not see that much changes, but most of the code was ported to different programming language and a lot of backend stuff has been changed but might look same for the end user. Porting to different language was planned already long time ago and took quite a while to do and it's finally ready to come to live servers. Most of the code was written in lua and now most of it is ported to javascript/typescript. Thanks to everyone who played on the test server and reported the bugs and gave some feedback.@here

> - Breaking any of our stated rules will result in disciplinary actions taken against you. Our disciplinary actions range from warnings, kicks, temporary bans, temporary mutes, permanent bans and permanent mutes.
> 
> - Not knowing the rules does not make anyone exempt from the rules. It is common sense to seek out the rules of any new server you join.
> 
> - Trying to skirt, find your way around, or exploit any rule can result in disciplinary actions.
> 
> - The staff team reserve all rights to apply disciplinary actions to any player they deem to have broken the stated rules.
> 
> - Not all rules can be listed as they are commonly expected behavioral rules. You as a player are expected to be mature and grown-up enough to understand this.
> 
> - Please make use of our reporting system. Using the game command "/Report [ID] [Reason]" will notify online staff of a problem. You can also report any player in the '<#653359901682434056>' or '<#838173386982686720>' channels on this Discord server. DO NOT CALL OUT CHEATERS IN PUBLIC CHAT. Just report them to staff.

Thank you for taking your time to read our rules. We hope we don't need to dispense disciplinary action against any player but occasionally rules are broken. Be sure to revise this channel often so you do not accidently break a rule and end up in trouble.

Thanks on behalf of the entire staff team on Busted servers!**BUSTED GAMEMODE RULES**

> 
> **2.** No homophobic, racist, crime-inciting, hateful, dark, or malicious material or messages are permitted.
> 
> **3.** Do NOT use any type of 3rd party mods/cheats on our servers. This will result in an unremovable ban.
> 
> **4.** Do NOT ram into other police cars, blockades of police cars, the robber, in anyway that would result in ruining the game for other people. Moderate how fast your car is going and always slow down when approaching a blockade of police cars (players).
> 
> **5.** Do NOT spam the chat. Spam is defined on our servers as 3+ consecutive messages of similar or the same content sent by the same player. You risk being muted.
> 
> **6.** Keep the public chat in English only. You may use any language you wish with private messages ("/PM [ID] [Message]")
> 
> **7.** Do NOT exploit any bugs or glitches. The anti-cheat may pick up on this and remove you. Report any bugs to staff in #bugs.
> 
> **8.** When piloting the helicopter, do not fly lower than street lamp level at any time. Using your aircraft to attack the robber will get you removed from our servers.
> 
> **9.** As robber, you are NOT allowed in RED zones on the minimap. Your round is forfeit if you do for long enough.
> 
> **10.** As robber, you are NOT allowed in tunnels. However, all illegal tunnels are blocked off with map editor. Any tunnels you can get into without glitching into are still allowed.

> 
> If you really think a staffs decision was wrong and you have any evidence to prove they are wrong (clips of you not cheating or breaking rules for example) then please create a support ticket in <#612762283919147035> and an admin will happily discuss with you. Please also bare in mind we constantly record on our servers and have full logs of everything that happens to back up our own actions.

> 
> If you have this evidence, please raise a ticket in <#612762283919147035> and an admin will speak with your shortly. If you raise a ticket without this evidence, and just want to argue over your ban, then you may be banned from our Discord server as well.

> 
> An application rejection may be determined even by your location. As people from around the globe join our servers, we must staff 24 hours a day as best as we can.

Plus, often the confirm button doesn't work or I accidentally quit the spawn menu, is there any way of spawning without reconnecting in such cases? 

A couple of months ago I don't think I had these issues (I'm playing on a HDD as my SSD is pretty much full)i found a bug <:Bugstars:840064645066653737>shit happens to me all the time lmao i rage about it a lot lmaoHow? Doesn’t really happen to meI would assume it's not busted eitherI dont play other servers so this is good newsSame but I think it has something to do with FiveM because it's not happening only on BustedI've been noticing lower fps as well at timesMy game fps is lower than usual, now its around 35 - 20. I also crash more frequently. Textures are at normal and the extended texture budget are at 0.<:PepeHands:608188340789051411>Hey <@526064082646728704>, welcome to **Car  Dealer Tropical**!Hey <@765774152665006090>, welcome to

Figured it outIs this right?but without bot tokenthe configWhat all should I share here for details?I set up everything for the Discord whitelist, but it still says my players cannot join due to not being whitelisted. They have the correct roles and everything. What am I doing wrong?**Threads early access**
One year ago _to the day_, we started on a journey to bring threads to Discord. Throughout that year, we've collected a _lot_ of feedback from the community, and there's been one consistent theme from everyone: **bots, bots, bots**. Everyone wants to make sure threads are supported by their preferred moderation bot.

Now, we know this is a pretty big update, so we've been trying to go above and beyond to be mindful of bots:
- We published API documentation _more than two months early_
- We bumped the API version so that old bots wouldn't crash
- We shared threads with Library Developers so they could have a head start getting updated. discord.js and discord.py both even merged support to master already!

And now, we're going to do something almost unprecedented for a new Discord product feature:
**We're letting bot developers test their bots with Threads BEFORE they even launch**

Here's how this will work:
- You have to be using the **Desktop Canary or PTB** clients. Additionally, you have to be in a server with AT MOST 5 members, AND one of those members **has to be a bot**
- If you meet those requirements, then just refresh your client and go to Server Settings, and you should see a new tab called "Threads" where you can opt-in.
- During this test you'll have access to all Premium Features for Threads as well, but keep in mind those *will* be removed when Threads launches.

If you have questions:
- Check out the documentation at: <https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/threads>
- Check out our Help Center article at: <https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/4403205878423>
- Otherwise, we'll be setting up a new channel here, `#threads-questions`. Please try to keep thread discussion out of <#697489244649816084>.

Finally, any API bug reports can be submitted as an issue on Github, but we aren't accepting any bug reports for UI stuff at this time.
